## 💰 Salary Negotiation Guide

### **Research Salaries**

**Resources:**
- levels.fyi (tech companies)
- Glassdoor (general)
- PayScale
- LinkedIn Salary

**Factors Affecting Salary:**
- Location (SF/NY vs other cities)
- Company size (FAANG vs startup)
- Experience level
- Specialization (NLP/CV pays more)
- Education (PhD vs Masters vs BS)
- Publication record

### **Negotiation Tips**

1. **Always negotiate** - Companies expect it
2. **Get multiple offers** - Leverage them
3. **Know your worth** - Research thoroughly
4. **Total compensation** - Consider stock, bonus, benefits
5. **Don't share current salary** - Anchor to market rate
6. **Be confident** - You earned this
7. **Get it in writing** - Verbal offers mean nothing

### **Example Script:**

```
"Thank you for the offer! I'm very excited about the role. 
Based on my research of market rates for [role] in [city], 
and considering my [skills/experience], I was expecting 
compensation in the range of [X-Y]. 

I have [competing offer/other interest] and would love to 
work something out that reflects the value I'll bring to 
the team. Is there flexibility in the offer?"
```
