## 🔥 Exam Hot Topics

### 1. CloudWatch Core Concepts
```
METRICS (What to Monitor)
├── Default Metrics (free, 5-min intervals)
│   └── EC2: CPU, Network, Disk (NOT memory/disk space)
├── Custom Metrics (charged, any interval)
│   └── Application-level, memory, disk space
└── Detailed Monitoring (1-min intervals, extra cost)

ALARMS (When to Alert)
├── OK - Metric within threshold
├── ALARM - Metric breached threshold
├── INSUFFICIENT_DATA - Not enough data
└── Actions: SNS, Auto Scaling, EC2 actions

LOGS (Centralized Logging)
├── Log Groups (application grouping)
├── Log Streams (instance/resource)
├── Metric Filters (extract metrics from logs)
├── Insights (query and analyze)
└── Export to S3 (archival)

EVENTS/EVENTBRIDGE (Automation)
├── Schedule-based (cron)
├── Event-based (state changes)
└── Targets: Lambda, SNS, SQS, etc.
```

**Memory Aid**: "MALE" = Metrics, Alarms, Logs, Events

### 2. CloudWatch Metrics - Important Facts
```
DEFAULT EC2 METRICS (Every 5 min, free)
✅ CPUUtilization
✅ NetworkIn/Out
✅ DiskReadOps/WriteOps
✅ StatusCheckFailed

NOT DEFAULT (Need custom metrics or CloudWatch agent)
❌ Memory utilization
❌ Disk space utilization
❌ Swap usage
❌ Process count

STANDARD RESOLUTION: 1 minute
HIGH RESOLUTION: 1 second (custom metrics only)
```

### 3. CloudTrail Key Features
```
WHAT IT LOGS:
├── Management Events (control plane)
│   └── CreateBucket, TerminateInstance, etc.
├── Data Events (data plane, charged)
│   └── S3 GetObject, Lambda Invoke, DynamoDB PutItem
└── Insights Events (unusual activity, ML-based)

DELIVERY:
├── Event history: 90 days (free, console)
├── Trail: Ongoing delivery to S3
├── CloudWatch Logs: Real-time monitoring
└── EventBridge: Trigger automated responses

VALIDATION:

```

**Exam Tip**: CloudTrail is region-specific unless you create a multi-region trail

### 4. AWS Config Rules
```
TYPES:
├── AWS Managed Rules (pre-built, 200+)
│   └── s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited
│   └── required-tags
│   └── encrypted-volumes
└── Custom Rules (Lambda-based)

COMPLIANCE:
├── Compliant (meets requirements)
├── Non-Compliant (violates rules)
└── Not Applicable (doesn't apply)

REMEDIATION:
├── Manual remediation
├── Automatic (Systems Manager Automation)
└── Example: Auto-enable encryption
```

## 💡 Common Exam Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Monitor EC2 Memory
**Q**: CloudWatch doesn't show EC2 memory usage
**✅ ANSWER**: Install CloudWatch agent on EC2, push custom metrics

### Scenario 2: Audit Who Deleted S3 Object
**Q**: Need to know who deleted specific S3 object
**✅ ANSWER**: CloudTrail with S3 data events enabled

### Scenario 3: Auto-Scale Based on Custom Metric
**Q**: Scale EC2 based on application queue depth
**✅ ANSWER**: Publish custom metric to CloudWatch → CloudWatch Alarm → Auto Scaling

### Scenario 4: Alert on High CPU
**Q**: Get notified when EC2 CPU > 80% for 5 minutes
**✅ ANSWER**: CloudWatch Alarm on CPUUtilization → SNS topic

### Scenario 5: Find Performance Bottleneck
**Q**: Distributed app slow, need to find which service causing delay
**✅ ANSWER**: AWS X-Ray (distributed tracing)

### Scenario 6: Ensure All S3 Buckets Encrypted
**Q**: Continuously verify S3 bucket encryption compliance
**✅ ANSWER**: AWS Config with s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled rule

### Scenario 7: Automate Response to Security Event
**Q**: Auto-revoke IAM key if exposed
**✅ ANSWER**: GuardDuty → EventBridge → Lambda (revoke key)

### Scenario 8: Centralize Logs from Multiple Accounts
**Q**: Aggregate logs from 50 AWS accounts
**✅ ANSWER**: CloudWatch Logs with cross-account subscriptions

## 🎓 Speed Learning Tips

### CloudWatch Alarm States
```
OK → ALARM → OK (cycle)

TRANSITIONS:
├── OK to ALARM: Metric breached
├── ALARM to OK: Metric back to normal
└── Any to INSUFFICIENT_DATA: Missing data

ACTIONS (can configure per state):
├── OK: Optional action
├── ALARM: Send notification, scale, etc.
└── INSUFFICIENT_DATA: Optional action
```

### CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Examples
```
# Find errors in last hour
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /ERROR/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20

# Count by status code
stats count() by status_code

# Average response time
stats avg(response_time) by bin(5m)
```

### Systems Manager Capabilities
```
PATCH MANAGER
└── Automate OS patching

SESSION MANAGER
└── Secure shell access (no SSH keys)

RUN COMMAND
└── Execute commands on fleet

PARAMETER STORE
└── Secure secrets/config storage

AUTOMATION

```

## 🚀 5-Minute Master Review

### Monitoring Decision Tree
```
1. What do you need?
   PERFORMANCE → CloudWatch Metrics
   WHO DID IT → CloudTrail
   COMPLIANCE → Config
   BOTTLENECKS → X-Ray
   
2. For CloudWatch, what specifically?
   METRICS → Performance data
   LOGS → Application logs
   ALARMS → Notifications
   EVENTS → Automation
   
3. For logging, what's the source?
   APPLICATION → CloudWatch Logs
   API CALLS → CloudTrail
   NETWORK → VPC Flow Logs
   LOAD BALANCER → ALB/NLB access logs
```

### CloudWatch Best Practices
✅ Use detailed monitoring for critical workloads
✅ Set up alarms for key metrics
✅ Aggregate logs in CloudWatch Logs
✅ Use metric filters to extract metrics from logs
✅ Set appropriate log retention periods
✅ Use CloudWatch Insights for log analysis
✅ Enable cross-region/account monitoring
✅ Use dashboards for visualization

### Common Monitoring Patterns
```
1. AUTO-SCALING PATTERN
   CloudWatch Metric → Alarm → Auto Scaling Policy
   
2. ALERTING PATTERN
   CloudWatch Alarm → SNS → Email/SMS/Lambda
   
3. LOG ANALYSIS PATTERN
   App → CloudWatch Logs → Metric Filter → Alarm
   
4. COMPLIANCE PATTERN
   Config Rule → Non-Compliant → EventBridge → Lambda (remediate)
   
5. INCIDENT RESPONSE
   GuardDuty/CloudTrail → EventBridge → Lambda → SNS
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Expecting EC2 memory in default metrics (need agent)
❌ Not enabling CloudTrail in all regions
❌ Forgetting CloudTrail data events cost extra
❌ Not setting log retention (unnecessary costs)
❌ Using CloudWatch when you need audit trail (use CloudTrail)
❌ Not using metric filters to extract data from logs
❌ Creating too many high-resolution custom metrics (expensive)
❌ Not configuring alarm actions properly
