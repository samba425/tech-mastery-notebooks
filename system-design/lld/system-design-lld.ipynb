    "\n",
    "When designing a class, ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SRP**: Does this class have one clear responsibility?\n",
    "2. **OCP**: Can I add features without modifying existing code?\n",
    "3. **LSP**: Can subclasses substitute the parent safely?\n",
    "4. **ISP**: Are interfaces focused (no fat interfaces)?\n",
    "5. **DIP**: Am I depending on abstractions, not concrete classes?\n",

    "1. **Identify responsibilities**: NotificationSender, NotificationFormatter, NotificationLogger (SRP)\n",
    "2. **Define abstraction**: NotificationChannel interface (DIP)\n",
    "3. **Implement channels**: EmailChannel, SMSChannel, PushChannel (OCP - add new without modifying)\n",
    "4. **Use composition**: NotificationService has NotificationChannel (Composition over inheritance)\n",
    "5. **Apply patterns**: Strategy (channel selection), Observer (notify subscribers)\n",
    "\n",
    "Code:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    @abstractmethod\n",

    "        self.log(user, formatted)  # SRP (separate logging)\n",

    "🎨 Design Patterns:\n",
    "1. **Strategy Pattern**: Different channels\n",
    "2. **Template Method**: Notification sending flow\n",
    "3. **Observer Pattern**: Subscribe to events\n",
    "4. **Queue Pattern**: Async processing\n",
    "\n",
    "🔄 Flow with Retry Logic:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Event occurs (new follower)\n",
    "2. Create notification\n",
    "3. Add to priority queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ)\n",
    "4. Worker picks from queue\n",
    "5. Check user preferences (quiet hours?)\n",
    "6. Select channel (email, push, sms)\n",
    "7. Attempt send\n",
    "8. If success: Mark delivered\n",
    "9. If failure: Retry with exponential backoff\n",
    "   - Retry 1: After 1 minute\n",
    "   - Retry 2: After 5 minutes  \n",
    "   - Retry 3: After 30 minutes\n",
    "   - Max retries: 3\n",
    "10. After max retries: Move to dead letter queue\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Interview Points:\n",
    "• Discuss deduplication (don't send same notif twice)\n",
    "• Rate limiting per user (max 10 emails/day)\n",
    "• Priority queue (high priority first)\n",
    "• Idempotency (handle duplicate events)\n",

    "### **Creational Patterns:**\n",
    "1. **Singleton** - One instance (Database connection pool)\n",
    "2. **Factory** - Create objects (Vehicle factory)\n",
    "3. **Builder** - Step-by-step construction (SQL query builder)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Structural Patterns:**\n",
    "4. **Adapter** - Interface compatibility (Old API → New API)\n",
    "5. **Decorator** - Add functionality (Logging decorator)\n",
    "6. **Facade** - Simplified interface (Payment facade)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Behavioral Patterns:**\n",
    "7. **Strategy** - Interchangeable algorithms (Sorting, Payment)\n",
    "8. **Observer** - Event notification (Pub/Sub)\n",
    "9. **Command** - Encapsulate requests (Undo/Redo)\n",
