**The Evolution Story - Why Full-Stack Became Essential:**

```
📅 The Old Days (Before 2010):
├── 👨‍💻 Frontend Developer - Only HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript
├── 👨‍💼 Backend Developer - Only server-side code
├── 🗃️ Database Admin - Only database management
└── 🔧 DevOps Engineer - Only server deployment

❌ Problems with Old Approach:
├── Communication gaps between teams
├── Slower development (waiting for other teams)
├── Higher costs (need multiple specialists)
├── Blame games when bugs occur
└── Difficult to maintain consistency
```

**Real Industry Example:**
```
🏢 Company wants to add "Login with Google" feature:

Old Way (4 weeks):
Week 1: Frontend team creates login button
Week 2: Backend team adds Google API integration  
Week 3: Database team modifies user tables
Week 4: Testing and fixing integration issues

New Way with Full-Stack Developer (3 days):
Day 1: Understand complete flow and plan
Day 2: Implement frontend + backend + database changes
Day 3: Test end-to-end and deploy

💰 Result: 90% faster, 70% cost reduction!
```

**Why Full-Stack Became Popular:**

```
🚀 Startup Revolution (2010-2020):
├── Limited budget and resources
├── Need to move fast and break things
├── One person who can build entire product
└── Reduced hiring and communication costs

📱 Mobile & Web Explosion:
├── Every business needs web + mobile apps

from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

# Add after app = FastAPI(...)
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # In production, specify exact domains
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

## 💡 BEGINNER-FRIENDLY EXAMPLES (Use in Demo)

### **Example 1: Variables (Like Labeled Boxes)**
```python
# Think of variables as labeled boxes in your home
name = "Rahul"        # Box labeled "name" contains "Rahul"
age = 25              # Box labeled "age" contains 25  
salary = 50000        # Box labeled "salary" contains 50000

print(f"Hi! I'm {name}, {age} years old, earning ₹{salary}")
```
**Output:** `Hi! I'm Rahul, 25 years old, earning ₹50000`

### **Example 2: If-Else (Like Traffic Lights)**
```python
# ATM money withdrawal logic
balance = 5000
withdraw_amount = 3000

if withdraw_amount <= balance:
    print("✅ Transaction successful!")
    new_balance = balance - withdraw_amount
    print(f"Remaining balance: ₹{new_balance}")
else:
    print("❌ Insufficient funds!")
```

### **Example 3: Loops (Repetitive Tasks)**
```python
# Send birthday wishes to all friends
friends = ["Amit", "Priya", "Rahul", "Sneha"]

for friend in friends:
    print(f"🎂 Happy Birthday {friend}!")
