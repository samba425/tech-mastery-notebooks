{"id":"teaching-plan","title":"🎓 Python Teaching Plan (12 Days)","content":"# Full Stack Python Development - Complete Course\n## 🎓 40 Hours Training Program for Complete Beginners\n\n**Course Duration:** 40 hours total (can be split into daily sessions)  \n**Target Audience:** Complete beginners (No IT background required)  \n**Teaching Style:** Simple explanations, real-world examples, hands-on practice\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 INTRODUCTION FOR COMPLETE BEGINNERS\n\n### **\"What is Programming?\" - In Simple Words**\n\n**Imagine you have a robot helper at home...**\n\nYou want this robot to make tea for you. But the robot doesn't know anything! You need to give it **step-by-step instructions**:\n\n```\n1. Go to kitchen\n2. Pick up kettle\n3. Fill water (exactly 2 cups)\n4. Turn on stove\n5. Wait until water boils\n6. Put tea bag in cup\n7. Pour hot water\n8. Wait 2 minutes\n9. Remove tea bag\n10. Add sugar (if person likes sweet)\n11. Bring tea to person\n```\n\n**This is exactly what programming is!** \n\nWriting step-by-step instructions for a computer to follow. Instead of a robot making tea, we write instructions for computers to:\n- Show websites\n- Play videos\n- Send messages\n- Calculate bills\n- Book tickets\n- And much more!\n\n---\n\n## 🐍 What is Python?\n\n### **Simple Answer:**\nPython is a **language** we use to talk to computers. \n\nJust like:\n- You speak **English** to talk to English-speaking people\n- You speak **Hindi** to talk to Hindi-speaking people\n- You write **Python** to talk to computers!\n\n### **Why is it called \"Python\"?**\nThe creator (Guido van Rossum) liked a comedy show called \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" - that's where the name came from! It has nothing to do with the snake! 🐍\n\n### **Real-Life Comparison:**\n\nThink of programming languages like **cooking recipes**:\n\n| Cooking | Programming |\n|---------|-------------|\n| Recipe Book | Code File |\n| Ingredients | Data (numbers, text) |\n| Cooking Steps | Instructions (code) |\n| Final Dish | Working Program |\n| Chef | Programmer (You!) |\n\n**Python is like a recipe book written in simple English!**\n\nOther languages (like C++, Java) are like recipes written in complicated chef language. Python keeps it simple!\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Why Learn Python? (Real Reasons)\n\n### **1. It's EASY - Really Easy!**\n\n**Python code:**\n```python\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n```\n\n**Other languages need:**\n```java\npublic class HelloWorld {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello World\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSee the difference? Python is simple!\n\n---\n\n### **2. Used by BIG Companies**\n\n| Company | What They Use Python For |\n|---------|-------------------------|\n| 🔍 **Google** | Search engine, YouTube |\n| 📸 **Instagram** | Entire backend (30+ million photos/day!) |\n| 🎵 **Spotify** | Music recommendations (\"You might like...\") |\n| 🎬 **Netflix** | Recommendation system (\"Watch Next\") |\n| 🚗 **Uber** | Calculate fares, find drivers nearby |\n| 🛒 **Amazon** | Product recommendations |\n| 🚀 **NASA** | Space exploration programs! |\n\n---\n\n### **3. High Salary Jobs**\n\n**In India:**\n- Beginner: ₹3-6 lakhs/year\n- 2-3 years: ₹6-12 lakhs/year\n- 5+ years: ₹15-30 lakhs/year\n- Expert: ₹40+ lakhs/year\n\n**Abroad (USA/Europe):**\n- $60,000 - $150,000+ per year\n\n---\n\n### **4. Build Anything You Want!**\n\nPython can build:\n\n✅ **Websites** - Like Amazon, Facebook\n✅ **Mobile Apps** - (backend part)\n✅ **Games** - Minecraft mods, simple games\n✅ **AI/Robots** - Self-driving cars, Siri-like assistants\n✅ **Data Analysis** - Stock market predictions, business reports\n✅ **Automation** - Auto-send emails, organize files\n✅ **IoT** - Control smart home devices\n\n---\n\n## 🌐 What is \"Full Stack\"?\n\n### **Simple Explanation:**\n\nImagine building a **restaurant** 🍽️\n\n**Frontend (Front of house):**\n- The **dining area** where customers sit\n- The **menu** they see\n- The **waiter** who takes orders\n- How things **look and feel**\n\n**Backend (Kitchen):**\n- The **kitchen** where food is cooked\n- The **chef** who prepares food\n- The **storage room** for ingredients\n- The **recipe book** with instructions\n\n**Full Stack = Frontend + Backend**\n\nA **Full Stack Developer** is like someone who can:\n1. Design the restaurant (Frontend)\n2. Cook the food (Backend)\n3. Manage everything!\n\n---\n\n## 🖥️ Full Stack in Web Terms (Very Simple)\n\n### **Example: Facebook**\n\nWhen you use Facebook, there are TWO parts:\n\n**1. Frontend (What You See) 🎨**\n```\n- The blue color\n- The like button\n- Your profile photo\n- The text box where you type\n- How it looks on your phone/computer\n```\n\n**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React\n\n**Think of it as:** The \"face\" of the application - what users see and click\n\n---\n\n**2. Backend (Hidden Magic) ⚙️**\n```\n- Storing your posts in database\n- Checking your password when you login\n- Sending notifications\n- Counting likes\n- Saving photos/videos\n- Friend suggestions\n```\n\n**Technologies:** Python, Flask/Django/FastAPI, Database\n\n**Think of it as:** The \"brain\" of the application - what makes everything work\n\n---\n\n### **Visual Diagram:**\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│         YOUR COMPUTER/PHONE             │\n│  ┌───────────────────────────────────┐  │\n│  │   FRONTEND (What you see)         │  │\n│  │   - Buttons, colors, text         │  │\n│  │   - React/JavaScript              │  │\n│  └───────────────────────────────────┘  │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n              ↕️ (Internet)\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│         SERVER (Company's Computer)     │\n│  ┌───────────────────────────────────┐  │\n│  │   BACKEND (Hidden processing)     │  │\n│  │   - Python code                   │  │\n│  │   - Database storage              │  │\n│  │   - Business logic                │  │\n│  └───────────────────────────────────┘  │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 How Frontend & Backend Work Together\n\n### **Real-Life Example: Ordering Pizza Online 🍕**\n\n**Step 1: You (Frontend)**\n- Open Domino's website\n- Click \"Order Now\" button\n- Select: Large Margherita Pizza\n- Enter delivery address\n- Click \"Place Order\"\n\n**Step 2: Backend (Python Code)**\n```python\n# Receives your order\norder = {\n    \"pizza\": \"Margherita\",\n    \"size\": \"Large\", \n    \"address\": \"123 Main Street\",\n    \"price\": 299\n}\n\n# Checks if pizza is available\nif pizza_available:\n    # Saves order in database\n    save_order(order)\n    # Calculates delivery time\n    time = calculate_delivery_time(address)\n    # Sends to kitchen\n    notify_kitchen(order)\n    # Sends you confirmation\n    send_confirmation_sms(phone_number)\n```\n\n**Step 3: You See (Frontend)**\n- \"Order Placed Successfully! ✅\"\n- \"Estimated Delivery: 30 minutes\"\n- \"Track your order\" button\n\n**This is Full Stack!** Frontend shows it, Backend processes it!\n\n---\n\n## 💼 What Will You Build in This Course?\n\nBy the end of this 40-hour course, you will build:\n\n### **🎯 Main Project: Blog Website (Like Medium.com)**\n\n**Features:**\n1. ✍️ Users can write articles\n2. 👤 User login/signup\n3. ❤️ Like and comment on posts\n4. 📸 Upload photos\n5. 🔍 Search articles\n6. 📱 Works on phone and computer\n\n**You will build BOTH:**\n- **Frontend** - How it looks (using React)\n- **Backend** - How it works (using Python)\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Course Structure (40 Hours)\n\n### **Part 1: Hours 1-10 - Python Basics** 🐍\n*Learn the Python language*\n- Writing code\n- Variables, loops, functions\n- Working with data\n- File handling\n\n**Real-life comparison:** Learning the alphabet before writing stories\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: Hours 11-20 - Backend Development** ⚙️\n*Build the \"brain\" of websites*\n- Databases (storing data)\n- APIs (connecting frontend to backend)\n- User authentication (login/signup)\n- Security\n\n**You'll build:** A backend that can save posts, manage users\n\n---\n\n### **Part 3: Hours 21-30 - Frontend Development** 🎨\n*Build the \"face\" of websites*\n- HTML/CSS (structure and design)\n- JavaScript (make things interactive)\n- React (modern way to build websites)\n- Making it look beautiful\n\n**You'll build:** A beautiful interface where users can see and create posts\n\n---\n\n### **Part 4: Hours 31-40 - Advanced Topics** 🚀\n*Professional-level skills*\n- Speed optimization\n- Handling millions of users\n- Security best practices\n- Deploying to internet (making it live!)\n\n**You'll build:** A production-ready application\n\n---\n\n## 🎓 Who Should Take This Course?\n\n### ✅ **Perfect For:**\n- Complete beginners (no coding experience needed)\n- Career changers (switching to IT)\n- Students wanting to learn programming\n- Anyone curious about how websites work\n- Non-IT professionals wanting new skills\n\n### ❌ **Not Required:**\n- Computer Science degree\n- Math skills (basic math is enough)\n- Previous coding experience\n- Expensive computer (any laptop works)\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ What You Need\n\n### **1.

Now building fintech applications!\"*\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 First 3 Topics Explained (Super Simple!)\n\n### **📝 Topic 1: Variables (Hour 2)**\n\n**Real-Life Analogy:**\n\nThink of variables as **labeled boxes** in your home:\n\n```python\n# Box labeled \"name\" contains \"Rahul\"\nname = \"Rahul\"\n\n# Box labeled \"age\" contains 25\nage = 25\n\n# Box labeled \"city\" contains \"Mumbai\"\ncity = \"Mumbai\"\n```\n\n**Like in real life:**\n- You have a **box labeled \"Keys\"** → You put car keys inside\n- You have a **box labeled \"Money\"** → You put cash inside\n- You have a **box labeled \"Medicines\"** → You put tablets inside\n\n**In programming:**\n- Variable named **\"username\"** → stores the user's name\n- Variable named **\"price\"** → stores the product price\n- Variable named **\"password\"** → stores the password\n\n**Example Students Will Understand:**\n\n```python\n# Making tea variables\ntea_cups = 2\nsugar_spoons = 3\nmilk_ml = 100\nboil_minutes = 5\n\nprint(f\"Making {tea_cups} cups of tea\")\nprint(f\"Adding {sugar_spoons} spoons of sugar\")\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nMaking 2 cups of tea\nAdding 3 spoons of sugar\n```\n\n**Real-World Use:**\n- Shopping cart: `total_price = 999`\n- WhatsApp: `message = \"Hello!\"`\n- Bank app: `balance = 50000`\n\n---\n\n### **🔀 Topic 2: If-Else (Conditions) (Hour 3)**\n\n**Real-Life Analogy:**\n\n**Think of a traffic light:**\n\n```python\nsignal = \"Red\"\n\nif signal == \"Red\":\n    print(\"STOP\")\nelif signal == \"Yellow\":\n    print(\"SLOW DOWN\")\nelse:\n    print(\"GO\")\n```\n\n**Another Example - Age Check (Like Movie Ticket Counter):**\n\n```python\nage = 16\n\nif age >= 18:\n    print(\"✅ You can watch the movie\")\nelse:\n    print(\"❌ Sorry, you're too young\")\n```\n\n**Real-World Examples:**\n\n**1. ATM Machine:**\n```python\nbalance = 5000\nwithdraw = 7000\n\nif withdraw <= balance:\n    print(\"✅ Money withdrawn\")\n    balance = balance - withdraw\nelse:\n    print(\"❌ Insufficient balance\")\n```\n\n**2. Temperature Check:**\n```python\ntemperature = 38\n\nif temperature > 37:\n    print(\"🤒 You have fever. Take medicine!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"😊 You're healthy\")\n```\n\n**3. Restaurant Bill:**\n```python\nbill = 1500\n\nif bill > 1000:\n    discount = bill * 0.10  # 10% discount\n    print(f\"🎉 You got ₹{discount} discount!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No discount today\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### **🔁 Topic 3: Loops (Repetition) (Hour 4)**\n\n**Real-Life Analogy:**\n\n**Think of washing dishes:**\n\nInstead of writing:\n```\n1. Wash plate 1\n2. Wash plate 2\n3. Wash plate 3\n4. Wash plate 4\n5. Wash plate 5\n```\n\nYou say: **\"Wash all plates, one by one\"**\n\n**In Python:**\n\n```python\n# Without loop (boring!)\nprint(\"Washing plate 1\")\nprint(\"Washing plate 2\")\nprint(\"Washing plate 3\")\nprint(\"Washing plate 4\")\nprint(\"Washing plate 5\")\n\n# With loop (smart!)\nfor plate_number in range(1, 6):\n    print(f\"Washing plate {plate_number}\")\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nWashing plate 1\nWashing plate 2\nWashing plate 3\nWashing plate 4\nWashing plate 5\n```\n\n**Real-World Examples:**\n\n**1. Sending Birthday Messages:**\n```python\nfriends = [\"Amit\", \"Priya\", \"Rahul\", \"Sneha\"]\n\nfor friend in friends:\n    print(f\"🎂 Happy Birthday {friend}!\")\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n🎂 Happy Birthday Amit!\n🎂 Happy Birthday Priya!\n🎂 Happy Birthday Rahul!\n🎂 Happy Birthday Sneha!\n```\n\n**2. Multiplication Table:**\n```python\nnumber = 5\n\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(f\"{number} × {i} = {number * i}\")\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n5 × 1 = 5\n5 × 2 = 10\n5 × 3 = 15\n...\n5 × 10 = 50\n```\n\n**3. Counting Money:**\n```python\nnotes = [500, 500, 100, 100, 50, 20, 10]\ntotal = 0\n\nfor note in notes:\n    total = total + note\n\nprint(f\"Total money: ₹{total}\")\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nTotal money: ₹1280\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Ready to Start?\n\n### **What You'll Learn Today (Hour 1):**\n1. ✅ What is Python and why companies use it\n2. ✅ Install Python on your computer\n3. ✅ Write your first program: \"Hello World\"\n4. ✅ Install VS Code (code editor)\n5. ✅ Run your first program\n\n### **By End of Course (Hour 40):**\n1. ✅ Build complete websites\n2. ✅ Create databases\n3. ✅ Handle user authentication\n4. ✅ Deploy to internet\n5. ✅ Add to resume and get jobs!\n\n---\n\n### **Remember:**\n\n> **\"Every expert was once a beginner.

Variables - Memory Concepts (10 min)\n2. Naming Conventions & Best Practices (10 min)\n3. Primitive Types: int, float, bool (15 min)\n4. Strings Basics (15 min)\n5. Hands-on Practice (10 min)\n\n---\n\n## 📝 DETAILED LESSON CONTENT\n\n### 1️⃣ Variables - Memory Concepts (10 minutes)\n\n**Explain to Students:**\n\n\"A variable is like a **labeled box** that stores information in computer memory.\n\n**Real-Life Example:**\n- You have a box labeled 'TOYS' → contains toys\n- You have a box labeled 'BOOKS' → contains books\n- In Python, `age = 25` → box labeled 'age' contains 25\n\n**Creating Variables:**\"\n\n```python\n# Variable = Value\nname = \"John\"      # Text (string)\nage = 25           # Number (integer)\nheight = 5.8       # Decimal (float)\nis_student = True  # True/False (boolean)\n```\n\n**How Variables Work in Memory:**\n\n```python\n# When you write:\nx = 10\n\n# Python does this:\n# 1. Creates space in memory\n# 2. Stores value 10 there\n# 3. Labels that space as 'x'\n# 4. Whenever you use 'x', Python gets the value from that space\n\n# You can change it anytime:\nx = 10\nprint(x)  # 10\nx = 20\nprint(x)  # 20 - value changed!\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Variable name is on the LEFT\n- Value is on the RIGHT\n- Use `=` to assign (store) value\n- Can change value anytime (that's why called \"variable\")\n\n---\n\n### 2️⃣ Naming Conventions & Best Practices (10 minutes)\n\n**Rules for Variable Names (MUST follow):**\n\n```python\n# ✅ ALLOWED\nname = \"John\"\nage = 25\nfirst_name = \"John\"\nfirstName = \"John\"  # Camel case\nuser_1 = \"John\"\n_private = \"secret\"\n\n# ❌ NOT ALLOWED\n1st_name = \"John\"    # Can't start with number\nfirst-name = \"John\"  # Can't use hyphen\nfirst name = \"John\"  # Can't have spaces\nclass = \"Python\"     # Can't use reserved words\nfor = 10             # Can't use reserved words\n```\n\n**Reserved Words (Can't Use as Variable Names):**\n```\nif, else, elif, while, for, def, class, import, from, \nreturn, True, False, None, and, or, not, in, is, etc.\n```\n\n**Naming Conventions (Best Practices):**\n\n```python\n# 1. Use lowercase with underscores (snake_case) - RECOMMENDED\nstudent_name = \"John\"\ntotal_marks = 85\nis_passed = True\n\n# 2.

Understanding Variables\n\n**Variables are like Storage Boxes 📦**\n\nImagine you have labeled boxes at home:\n- A box labeled \"TOYS\" contains toys\n- A box labeled \"BOOKS\" contains books\n- You can change what's inside anytime\n- The label helps you remember what's inside\n\nSimilarly, variables are containers that store data:\n\n```python\n# Variable = Labeled box\ntoy_box = \"Teddy Bear\"        # Box labeled \"toy_box\" contains \"Teddy Bear\"\nbook_box = \"Harry Potter\"     # Box labeled \"book_box\" contains \"Harry Potter\"\n\n# You can change contents anytime\ntoy_box = \"Race Car\"          # Changed contents of toy_box\nprint(toy_box)                # Shows: Race Car\n\n# Better box labels = Better organization\nmy_age = 25                   # Clear label ✓\na = 25                        # Confusing label ✗\n```\n\n**Real Example - Student Information:**\n```python\n# Like student ID card with different fields\nstudent_name = \"Rahul Kumar\"\nstudent_age = 20\nstudent_grade = \"A\"\nis_present = True\n\n# Each variable is like a field on ID card\nprint(f\"Student: {student_name}\")\nprint(f\"Age: {student_age}\")\nprint(f\"Grade: {student_grade}\")\nprint(f\"Present today: {is_present}\")\n```\n\n**Common Beginner Mistake:**\n```python\n# ❌ BAD - Cryptic names\npn = \"John\"\na = 25\n\n# ✅ GOOD - Descriptive names\nperson_name = \"John\"\nage = 25\n\n# Remember: Code is read more than written!\n```\n\n### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid\n```python\n# ❌ WRONG - Using reserved keywords as variables\nclass = \"Python\"  # 'class' is reserved keyword\nfor = 5           # 'for' is reserved keyword\n\n# ✅ CORRECT\nclass_name = \"Python\"\niteration_count = 5\n\n# ❌ WRONG - Starting variable with number\n1st_name = \"John\"  # Error!\n\n# ✅ CORRECT\nfirst_name = \"John\"\n\n# ❌ WRONG - Using spaces in variable names\nstudent name = \"Alice\"  # Error!\n\n# ✅ CORRECT\nstudent_name = \"Alice\"\n```\n\n### 🎯 Quick Revision Questions\n1.

Practice Exercises (5 min)\n\n---\n\n## 📝 DETAILED LESSON CONTENT\n\n### 1️⃣ String Creation & Quotes (10 minutes)\n\n**Explain to Students:**\n\n\"Strings are text data. In Python, you can create strings using three ways:\"\n\n```python\n# Method 1: Single quotes\nname = 'John'\nmessage = 'Hello World'\n\n# Method 2: Double quotes\nname = \"John\"\nmessage = \"Hello World\"\n\n# Method 3: Triple quotes (for multiple lines)\nparagraph = \"\"\"This is line 1\nThis is line 2\nThis is line 3\"\"\"\n\n# All three are valid strings!\n```\n\n**When to use which?**\n\n```python\n# Use single quotes normally\nmessage = 'Hello'\n\n# Use double quotes when text contains single quote\nsentence = \"It's a beautiful day\"  # Has apostrophe\n\n# Use triple quotes for long text\nbio = \"\"\"\nI am a Python developer.\nI love coding.\nI am learning every day.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Escape characters (special cases)\nprint(\"He said, \\\"Hello\\\"\")  # He said, \"Hello\"\nprint('It\\'s working')        # It's working\n```\n\n**String as a Sequence:**\n\n```python\n# Strings are sequences of characters\nword = \"PYTHON\"\n\n# Each character has a position (index)\n# P Y T H O N\n# 0 1 2 3 4 5  (forward indexing)\n# -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  (backward indexing)\n\nprint(word[0])   # P\nprint(word[5])   # N\nprint(word[-1])  # N (last character)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2️⃣ String Indexing & Slicing (15 minutes)\n\n**Indexing - Access Single Character:**\n\n```python\ntext = \"PYTHON\"\n\n# Forward indexing (starts at 0)\nprint(text[0])   # P - first character\nprint(text[1])   # Y - second character\nprint(text[5])   # N - last character\n\n# Backward indexing (starts at -1)\nprint(text[-1])  # N - last character\nprint(text[-2])  # O - second last\nprint(text[-6])  # P - first character\n\n# Out of range causes error\n# print(text[10])  # Error! Index out of range\n```\n\n**Slicing - Extract Multiple Characters:**\n\n**Syntax:** `string[start:end:step]`\n- start: where to begin (included)\n- end: where to stop (NOT included)\n- step: how many to skip (optional)\n\n```python\ntext = \"PYTHON\"\n\n# Basic slicing\nprint(text[0:3])   # PYT (index 0,1,2)\nprint(text[2:5])   # THO (index 2,3,4)\n\n# Shortcuts\nprint(text[:3])    # PYT (from start to 3)\nprint(text[2:])    # THON (from 2 to end)\nprint(text[:])     # PYTHON (complete string)\n\n# Negative indices\nprint(text[-4:])   # THON (last 4 characters)\nprint(text[:-2])   # PYTH (all except last 2)\n\n# Step (skip characters)\nprint(text[::2])   # PTO (every 2nd character)\nprint(text[::3])   # PH (every 3rd character)\nprint(text[::-1])  # NOHTYP (reverse!)\n\n# Practical examples\nemail = \"user@gmail.com\"\nusername = email[:4]        # user\ndomain = email[5:]          # gmail.com\nprint(f\"Username: {username}\")\nprint(f\"Domain: {domain}\")\n```\n\n**Visual Diagram (Draw on board):**\n\n```\nString: \"PYTHON\"\nIndex:   0 1 2 3 4 5\n         P Y T H O N\nIndex:  -6-5-4-3-2-1\n\n[0:3]  = PYT (0,1,2)\n[2:5]  = THO (2,3,4)\n[:3]   = PYT (start to 3)\n[3:]   = HON (3 to end)\n[::-1] = NOHTYP (reversed)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3️⃣ String Methods (20 minutes)\n\n**Case Conversion Methods:**\n\n```python\ntext = \"python programming\"\n\n# Change case\nprint(text.upper())       #

PYTHON PROGRAMMING (swap case)\n\n# Real example: Name formatting\nname = \"john doe\"\nprint(name.title())  # John Doe - proper name format\n```\n\n**Whitespace Methods:**\n\n```python\ntext = \"  hello world  \"\n\nprint(text.strip())   # \"hello world\" (remove both sides)\nprint(text.lstrip())  # \"hello world  \" (remove left)\nprint(text.rstrip())  # \"  hello world\" (remove right)\n\n# Real example: Clean user input\nusername = input(\"Enter username: \")  # User types: \"  john  \"\nusername = username.strip()            # Clean: \"john\"\n```\n\n**Search Methods:**\n\n```python\ntext = \"Python is awesome and Python is easy\"\n\n# Find position\nprint(text.find(\"Python\"))      #

Can't use = in condition\nif x == 10:   # ✅ Correct!\n    print(\"x is 10\")\n```\n\n**Comparing Strings:**\n\n```python\n# Case-sensitive comparison\nprint(\"Hello\" == \"Hello\")  # True\nprint(\"Hello\" == \"hello\")  # False\n\n# Alphabetical order\nprint(\"apple\" < \"banana\")  # True (a comes before b)\nprint(\"ABC\" < \"abc\")       # True (uppercase comes first)\n\n# Length doesn't matter\nprint(\"a\" < \"zzzz\")        # True (alphabetical, not length)\n```\n\n**Practical Examples:**\n\n```python\n# Age verification\nage = 18\nprint(age >= 18)  # True - eligible to vote\n\n# Password check\npassword = \"secret123\"\nuser_input = \"secret123\"\nprint(password == user_input)  # True - correct password\n\n# Grade checking\nmarks = 75\nprint(marks >= 40)  # True - passing marks\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2️⃣ Logical Operators (10 minutes)\n\n**Three Logical Operators: AND, OR, NOT**\n\n**Operator 1: AND - Both conditions must be True**\n\n```python\n# and - returns True only if BOTH are True\nprint(True and True)    # True\nprint(True and False)   # False\nprint(False and True)   # False\nprint(False and False)  # False\n\n# Practical example\nage = 25\nhas_license = True\n\n# Can drive if age >= 18 AND has license\ncan_drive = age >= 18 and has_license\nprint(can_drive)  # True\n\n# Real scenario\ntemperature = 25\nis_sunny = True\n# Go to beach if temp > 20 AND sunny\ngo_to_beach = temperature > 20 and is_sunny\nprint(go_to_beach)  # True\n```\n\n**Operator 2: OR - At least one condition must be True**\n\n```python\n# or - returns True if AT LEAST ONE is True\nprint(True or True)     # True\nprint(True or False)    # True\nprint(False or True)    # True\nprint(False or False)   # False\n\n# Practical example\nis_weekend = True\nis_holiday = False\n\n# Can relax if weekend OR holiday\ncan_relax = is_weekend or is_holiday\nprint(can_relax)  # True\n\n# Real scenario\nhas_card = False\nhas_cash = True\n# Can pay if has card OR cash\ncan_pay = has_card or has_cash\nprint(can_pay)  # True\n```\n\n**Operator 3: NOT - Reverses the condition**\n\n```python\n# not - reverses True/False\nprint(not True)   # False\nprint(not False)  # True\n\n# Practical example\nis_raining = False\ngo_outside = not is_raining\nprint(go_outside)  # True\n\n# Real scenario\nis_blocked = False\ncan_access = not is_blocked\nprint(can_access)  # True\n```\n\n**Combining Multiple Operators:**\n\n```python\n# Complex conditions\nage = 25\nhas_license = True\nis_sober = True\n\n# Can drive if: age >= 18 AND has license AND is sober\ncan_drive = age >= 18 and has_license and is_sober\nprint(can_drive)  # True\n\n# Another example\nscore = 85\nattendance = 75\n\n# Pass if: score >= 40 OR attendance >= 80\nwill_pass = score >= 40 or attendance >= 80\nprint(will_pass)  # True\n\n# Using NOT\nis_banned = False\nis_verified = True\ncan_post = not is_banned and is_verified\nprint(can_post)  # True\n```\n\n**Truth Tables (Show on Board):**\n\n```\nAND Truth Table:\nTrue  and True  = True\nTrue  and False = False\nFalse and True  = False\nFalse and False = False\n\nOR Truth Table:\nTrue  or True  = True\nTrue  or False = True\nFalse or True  = True\nFalse or False = False\n\nNOT Truth Table:\nnot True  = False\nnot False = True\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3️⃣ If/Elif/Else Statements (20 minutes)\n\n**Basic If Statement:**\n\n```python\n# If syntax\nif condition:\n    # code runs only if condition is True\n    print(\"Condition is True\")\n\n# Example\nage = 20\nif age >= 18:\n    print(\"You are an adult\")\n```\n\n**If-Else Statement:**\n\n```python\n# If-else syntax\nif condition:\n    # runs if True\n    print(\"True block\")\nelse:\n    # runs if False\n    print(\"False block\")\n\n# Example\nage = 15\nif age >= 18:\n    print(\"You can vote\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You cannot vote yet\")\n```\n\n**If-Elif-Else Statement (Multiple Conditions):**\n\n```python\n# If-elif-else syntax\nif condition1:\n    # runs if condition1 is True\n    print(\"First condition\")\nelif condition2:\n    # runs if condition2 is True\n    print(\"Second condition\")\nelif condition3:\n    # runs if condition3 is True\n    print(\"Third condition\")\nelse:\n    # runs if all conditions are False\n    print(\"None of the conditions met\")\n\n# Example: Grade system\nmarks = 85\n\nif marks >= 90:\n    grade = \"A\"\nelif marks >= 80:\n    grade = \"B\"\nelif marks >= 70:\n    grade = \"C\"\nelif marks >= 60:\n    grade = \"D\"\nelse:\n    grade = \"F\"\n\nprint(f\"Your grade: {grade}\")\n```\n\n**Important: Indentation Matters!**\n\n```python\n# ❌ WRONG - No indentation\nif age >= 18:\nprint(\"Adult\")  # Error!\n\n# ✅ CORRECT - 4 spaces or 1 tab\nif age >= 18:\n    print(\"Adult\")\n\n# ❌ WRONG - Inconsistent indentation\nif age >= 18:\n    print(\"Adult\")\n     print(\"Can vote\")  # Extra space -

Practice Problems (5 min)\n\n---\n\n## 📝 DETAILED LESSON CONTENT\n\n### 1️⃣ While Loops (15 minutes)\n\n**What is a Loop?**\n\n\"A loop repeats code multiple times automatically. Think of it like a washing machine that keeps washing until clothes are clean.\"\n\n**While Loop Syntax:**\n\n```python\nwhile condition:\n    # Code repeats while condition is True\n    print(\"Running...\")\n```\n\n**Basic While Loop:**\n\n```python\n# Print numbers 1 to 5\ncount = 1\nwhile count <= 5:\n    print(count)\n    count += 1  # IMPORTANT: Must update count!\n\n# Output:\n# 1\n# 2\n# 3\n# 4\n# 5\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n1. Condition is checked BEFORE each iteration\n2. If condition is False, loop stops\n3. Must update the variable to avoid infinite loop\n4. Use while when you don't know how many times to loop\n\n**Example 1: Countdown**\n\n```python\n# Countdown from 10\ncountdown = 10\nwhile countdown > 0:\n    print(countdown)\n    countdown -= 1\nprint(\"Blast off! 🚀\")\n```\n\n**Example 2: Sum Until Threshold**\n\n```python\ntotal = 0\nnumber = 1\n\nwhile total < 100:\n    total += number\n    print(f\"Added {number}, total = {total}\")\n    number += 1\n\nprint(f\"Final total: {total}\")\n```\n\n**Example 3: User Input Validation**\n\n```python\n# Keep asking until valid input\npassword = \"\"\nwhile password != \"secret\":\n    password = input(\"Enter password: \")\n    if password != \"secret\":\n        print(\"Wrong password! Try again.\")\n    \nprint(\"Access granted! ✓\")\n```\n\n**Example 4: ATM with Retry Limit**\n\n```python\npin = \"1234\"\nattempts = 0\nmax_attempts = 3\n\nwhile attempts < max_attempts:\n    user_pin = input(\"Enter PIN: \")\n    \n    if user_pin == pin:\n        print(\"✓ Correct PIN!\")\n        break  # Exit loop early\n    else:\n        attempts += 1\n        remaining = max_attempts - attempts\n        if remaining > 0:\n            print(f\"❌ Wrong PIN! {remaining} attempts left\")\n        else:\n            print(\"🔒 Card blocked!\")\n```\n\n**⚠️ DANGER: Infinite Loop**\n\n```python\n# ❌ This will run FOREVER!\n# count = 1\n# while count <= 5:\n#     print(count)\n#     # Forgot to update count!\n\n# ✅ Always update the variable!\ncount = 1\nwhile count <= 5:\n    print(count)\n    count += 1  # Updates count\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2️⃣ For Loops & Range (20 minutes)\n\n**What is a For Loop?**\n\n\"For loop repeats code a FIXED number of times. Like printing report cards for all 30 students in class.\"\n\n**For Loop Syntax:**\n\n```python\nfor variable in sequence:\n    # Code repeats for each item\n    print(variable)\n```\n\n**Basic For Loop with Range:**\n\n```python\n# Print numbers 0 to 4\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n\n# Output:\n# 0\n# 1\n# 2\n# 3\n# 4\n```\n\n**Understanding range():**\n\n```python\n# range(stop) - starts at 0\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)  # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n# range(start, stop) - custom start\nfor i in range(1, 6):\n    print(i)  # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n# range(start, stop, step) - custom increment\nfor i in range(0, 10, 2):\n    print(i)  # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n\n# Countdown (negative step)\nfor i in range(10, 0, -1):\n    print(i)  # 10, 9, 8, ..., 1\n```\n\n**Looping Through Lists:**\n\n```python\n# Loop through list of items\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\", \"mango\"]\n\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\n\n# With index using enumerate()\nfor index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n    print(f\"{index + 1}. {fruit}\")\n\n# Output:\n# 1. apple\n# 2. banana\n# 3. orange\n# 4. mango\n```\n\n**Looping Through Strings:**\n\n```python\n# Each character one by one\nname = \"PYTHON\"\nfor letter in name:\n    print(letter)\n\n# Output:\n# P\n# Y\n# T\n# H\n# O\n# N\n```\n\n**Example 1: Multiplication Table**\n\n```python\nnumber = 7\nprint(f\"Multiplication Table of {number}\")\nprint(\"=\" * 30)\n\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    result = number * i\n    print(f\"{number} × {i:2} = {result:3}\")\n```\n\n**Example 2: Sum of Numbers**\n\n```python\n# Sum of first 10 numbers\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    total += i\n    print(f\"After adding {i}: total = {total}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nFinal sum: {total}\")\n```\n\n**Example 3: Menu Display**\n\n```python\nmenu = [\"Pizza\", \"Burger\", \"Pasta\", \"Salad\"]\nprices = [250, 150, 200, 100]\n\nprint(\"🍕 RESTAURANT MENU\")\nprint(\"=\" * 30)\n\nfor i in range(len(menu)):\n    print(f\"{i+1}. {menu[i]:<15} ₹{prices[i]}\")\n\nprint(\"=\" * 30)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3️⃣ Break & Continue (10 minutes)\n\n**Break - Exit Loop Immediately**\n\n```python\n# break stops the loop completely\nfor i in range(10):\n    if i == 5:\n        break  # Stop when i is 5\n    print(i)\n\n# Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (stops at 5)\n```\n\n**Example: Search in List**\n\n```python\nstudents = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\"]\nsearch_name = \"Charlie\"\n\nfor student in students:\n    if student == search_name:\n        print(f\"✓ Found {student}!\")\n        break  # Stop searching once found\nelse:\n    print(f\"✗ {search_name} not found\")\n```\n\n**Continue - Skip Current Iteration**\n\n```python\n# continue skips to next iteration\nfor i in range(10):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        continue  # Skip even numbers\n    print(i)\n\n# Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (odd numbers only)\n```\n\n**Example: Print Only Passing Students**\n\n```python\nstudents = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\", \"Eve\"]\nmarks = [85, 35, 90, 42, 30]\n\nprint(\"📋 PASSING STUDENTS:\")\nfor i in range(len(students)):\n    if marks[i] < 40:\n        continue  # Skip failing students\n    print(f\"✓ {students[i]}: {marks[i]} marks\")\n```\n\n**Break vs Continue Comparison:**\n\n```python\nprint(\"With break:\")\nfor i in range(10):\n    if i == 5:\n        break\n    print(i)  # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (stops completely)\n\nprint(\"\\nWith continue:\")\nfor i in range(10):\n    if i == 5:\n        continue\n    print(i)  # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 (skips 5 only)\n```\n\n**Example: Password Validator**\n\n```python\npassword = \"Abc123\"\n\nprint(\"Password Requirements:\")\nprint(\"- At least 6 characters\")\nprint(\"- Contains uppercase letter\")\nprint(\"- Contains number\")\nprint()\n\n# Check length\nif len(password) < 6:\n    print(\"❌ Too short!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"✓ Length OK\")\n\n# Check uppercase\nhas_upper = False\nfor char in password:\n    if char.isupper():\n        has_upper = True\n        break  # Found one, stop checking\n\nif has_upper:\n    print(\"✓ Has uppercase\")\nelse:\n    print(\"❌ Needs uppercase\")\n\n# Check digit\nhas_digit = False\nfor char in password:\n    if char.isdigit():\n        has_digit = True\n        break\n\nif has_digit:\n    print(\"✓ Has digit\")\nelse:\n    print(\"❌ Needs digit\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4️⃣ Nested Loops (10 minutes)\n\n**What are Nested Loops?**\n\n\"Loop inside another loop - like checking every seat in every row of a cinema hall.\"\n\n**Basic Nested Loop:**\n\n```python\n# Outer loop runs 3 times\nfor i in range(3):\n    # Inner loop runs 4 times for EACH outer loop\n    for j in range(4):\n        print(f\"i={i}, j={j}\")\n```\n\n**Example 1: Multiplication Table (1-10)**\n\n```python\nprint(\"MULTIPLICATION TABLES (1-5)\")\nprint(\"=\" * 40)\n\nfor num in range(1, 6):\n    print(f\"\\nTable of {num}:\")\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        print(f\"{num} × {i:2} = {num*i:3}\")\n```\n\n**Example 2: Pattern - Right Triangle**\n\n```python\n# Print star pattern\nprint(\"Star Triangle:\")\nfor i in range(1, 6):\n    for j in range(i):\n        print(\"*\", end=\" \")\n    print()  # New line after each row\n\n# Output:\n# * \n# * * \n# * * * \n# * * * * \n# * * * * *\n```\n\n**Example 3: Pattern - Number Pyramid**\n\n```python\n# Number pyramid\nrows = 5\nfor i in range(1, rows + 1):\n    # Print spaces\n    for j in range(rows - i):\n        print(\" \", end=\"\")\n    # Print numbers\n    for k in range(1, i + 1):\n        print(k, end=\" \")\n    print()\n\n# Output:\n#     1 \n#    1 2 \n#   1 2 3 \n#  1 2 3 4 \n# 1 2 3 4 5\n```\n\n**Example 4: 2D Grid/Matrix**\n\n```python\n# Print 3x4 grid\nrows = 3\ncols = 4\n\nprint(\"Grid Pattern:\")\nfor i in range(rows):\n    for j in range(cols):\n        print(\"*\", end=\" \")\n    print()  # New line after each row\n\n# Output:\n# * * * * \n# * * * * \n# * * * *\n```\n\n**Example 5: Student Marks Table**\n\n```python\nstudents = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"]\nsubjects = [\"Math\", \"Science\", \"English\"]\n\nprint(\"STUDENT MARKS\")\nprint(\"=\" * 50)\nprint(f\"{'Student':<12}\", end=\"\")\nfor subject in subjects:\n    print(f\"{subject:>10}\", end=\"\")\nprint()\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\nfor student in students:\n    print(f\"{student:<12}\", end=\"\")\n    for subject in subjects:\n        # Random marks for demo\n        marks = 85\n        print(f\"{marks:>10}\", end=\"\")\n    print()\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5️⃣ Practice Problems (5 minutes)\n\n**Problem 1: Even Numbers**\n```python\n# Print even numbers from 1 to 20\nprint(\"Even numbers:\")\nfor i in range(1, 21):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        print(i, end=\" \")\nprint()\n```\n\n**Problem 2: Factorial**\n```python\n# Calculate factorial of a number\nn = 5\nfactorial = 1\n\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    factorial *= i\n\nprint(f\"{n}! = {factorial}\")  # 5! = 120\n```\n\n**Problem 3: Reverse String**\n```python\n# Reverse a string using loop\ntext = \"PYTHON\"\nreversed_text = \"\"\n\nfor char in text:\n    reversed_text = char + reversed_text\n\nprint(f\"Original: {text}\")\nprint(f\"Reversed: {reversed_text}\")\n```\n\n**Problem 4: Count Vowels**\n```python\n# Count vowels in a sentence\nsentence = \"Python Programming is Fun\"\nvowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\ncount = 0\n\nfor char in sentence:\n    if char in vowels:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(f\"Vowels in '{sentence}': {count}\")\n```\n\n**Problem 5: FizzBuzz**\n```python\n# Print numbers 1-20, but:\n# -

Like a vending machine button - press it, it does its job.\"\n\n**Why Use Functions?**\n\n1. **Reusability** - Write once, use many times\n2. **Organization** - Break big problems into small pieces\n3. **Easier to maintain** - Fix in one place\n4. **Avoid repetition** - DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)\n\n**Function Syntax:**\n\n```python\ndef function_name():\n    # Code to execute\n    print(\"Function running\")\n\n# Call the function\nfunction_name()\n```\n\n**Example 1: Simple Greeting**\n\n```python\n# Define function\ndef greet():\n    print(\"Hello!\")\n    print(\"Welcome to Python\")\n    print(\"Let's learn functions\")\n\n# Call function (can call multiple times)\ngreet()\ngreet()\ngreet()\n```\n\n**Example 2: Without Function (Repetitive)**\n\n```python\n# ❌ Repeating code\nprint(\"=\" * 30)\nprint(\"Welcome to Python!\")\nprint(\"=\" * 30)\n\nprint(\"=\" * 30)\nprint(\"Welcome to Django!\")\nprint(\"=\" * 30)\n\nprint(\"=\" * 30)\nprint(\"Welcome to Machine Learning!\")\nprint(\"=\" * 30)\n```\n\n**Example 3: With Function (Clean)**\n\n```python\n# ✅ Using function\ndef print_header(title):\n    print(\"=\" * 30)\n    print(title)\n    print(\"=\" * 30)\n\nprint_header(\"Welcome to Python!\")\nprint_header(\"Welcome to Django!\")\nprint_header(\"Welcome to Machine Learning!\")\n```\n\n**Function Naming Rules:**\n\n```python\n# ✅ Good function names (descriptive, lowercase, underscores)\ndef calculate_total():\n    pass\n\ndef send_email():\n    pass\n\ndef get_user_input():\n    pass\n\n# ❌ Bad function names\ndef ct():  # Not descriptive\n    pass\n\ndef CalculateTotal():  # Should be lowercase\n    pass\n\ndef calculate-total():  # Can't use hyphens\n    pass\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2️⃣ Parameters & Arguments (15 minutes)\n\n**What are Parameters?**\n\n\"Parameters are inputs to a function - like ingredients for a recipe.\"\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n```python\ndef function_name(parameter1, parameter2):\n    # Use parameters inside function\n    print(parameter1, parameter2)\n\n# Call with arguments\nfunction_name(\"value1\", \"value2\")\n```\n\n**Terminology:**\n- **Parameter**: Variable in function definition\n- **Argument**: Actual value passed when calling\n\n```python\ndef greet(name):  # 'name' is parameter\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\ngreet(\"John\")  # \"John\" is argument\n```\n\n**Example 1: Single Parameter**\n\n```python\ndef greet(name):\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n    print(f\"Welcome to the class!\")\n\ngreet(\"Alice\")\ngreet(\"Bob\")\ngreet(\"Charlie\")\n```\n\n**Example 2: Multiple Parameters**\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    result = a + b\n    print(f\"{a} + {b} = {result}\")\n\nadd_numbers(10, 5)  # 10 + 5 = 15\nadd_numbers(100, 200)  # 100 + 200 = 300\n```\n\n**Example 3: Calculate Rectangle Area**\n\n```python\ndef calculate_area(length, width):\n    area = length * width\n    print(f\"Length: {length}\")\n    print(f\"Width: {width}\")\n    print(f\"Area: {area}\")\n\ncalculate_area(10, 5)  # 50\ncalculate_area(20, 8)  # 160\n```\n\n**Positional Arguments (Order Matters):**\n\n```python\ndef introduce(name, age, city):\n    print(f\"I am {name}\")\n    print(f\"I am {age} years old\")\n    print(f\"I live in {city}\")\n\n# Order matters!\nintroduce(\"John\", 25, \"Mumbai\")  # Correct order\nintroduce(25, \"Mumbai\", \"John\")  # Wrong! Age first\n```\n\n**Keyword Arguments (Order Doesn't Matter):**\n\n```python\ndef introduce(name, age, city):\n    print(f\"I am {name}, {age} years old, from {city}\")\n\n# Keyword arguments - order doesn't matter\nintroduce(name=\"John\", age=25, city=\"Mumbai\")\nintroduce(age=25, city=\"Mumbai\", name=\"John\")  # Same result!\nintroduce(city=\"Mumbai\", name=\"John\", age=25)  # Still works!\n```\n\n**Mixing Positional and Keyword:**\n\n```python\ndef book_ticket(name, from_city, to_city, date):\n    print(f\"Passenger: {name}\")\n    print(f\"From: {from_city} → To: {to_city}\")\n    print(f\"Date: {date}\")\n\n# Mix both (positional first, then keyword)\nbook_ticket(\"John\", \"Mumbai\", to_city=\"Delhi\", date=\"2025-01-15\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3️⃣ Return Values (15 minutes)\n\n**What is Return?**\n\n\"Return sends data back from function to caller.

Like a sealed box - you can see inside but can't modify.\"\n\n**Creating Tuples:**\n\n```python\n# Using parentheses\nfruits = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"mango\")\nprint(fruits)  # ('apple', 'banana', 'mango')\n\n# Without parentheses (also works)\nnumbers = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nprint(numbers)  # (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# Single element tuple (need comma!)\nsingle = (10,)  # Comma is required\nprint(type(single))  # <class 'tuple'>\n\nwrong = (10)  # Without comma - it's just an int!\nprint(type(wrong))  # <class 'int'>\n\n# Empty tuple\nempty = ()\n```\n\n**Accessing Tuple Elements:**\n\n```python\ncoordinates = (10, 20, 30)\n\n# Indexing (same as lists)\nprint(coordinates[0])   # 10\nprint(coordinates[-1])  # 30\n\n# Slicing\nprint(coordinates[1:])  # (20, 30)\n\n# Length\nprint(len(coordinates))  # 3\n```\n\n**Tuples are IMMUTABLE:**\n\n```python\nfruits = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"mango\")\n\n# ❌ Cannot modify\n# fruits[0] = \"orange\"  # Error: tuple object does not support item assignment\n\n# ❌ Cannot add\n# fruits.append(\"grape\")  # Error: no append method\n\n# ❌ Cannot remove\n# fruits.remove(\"banana\")  # Error: no remove method\n```\n\n**When to Use Tuples:**\n\n1. **Fixed data** - Like coordinates, dates, RGB colors\n2. **Data that shouldn't change** - Like configuration values\n3. **Dictionary keys** - Tuples can be keys, lists cannot\n4. **Faster than lists** - Tuples are slightly faster\n\n**Tuple Methods:**\n\n```python\nnumbers = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2)\n\n# count() - count occurrences\nprint(numbers.count(2))  # 3\n\n# index() - find position\nprint(numbers.index(4))  # 4\n\n# Only 2 methods! (because immutable)\n```\n\n**Practical Examples:**\n\n```python\n# RGB color (shouldn't change)\nred = (255, 0, 0)\ngreen = (0, 255, 0)\nblue = (0, 0, 255)\n\n# Date (fixed)\ntoday = (2025, 1, 15)  # year, month, day\nyear, month, day = today  # Unpacking\nprint(f\"Date: {day}/{month}/{year}\")\n\n# GPS coordinates\nlocation = (19.0760, 72.8777)  # Mumbai\nlatitude, longitude = location\nprint(f\"Lat: {latitude}, Long: {longitude}\")\n```\n\n**Tuple Unpacking:**\n\n```python\n# Multiple assignment\nperson = (\"John\", 25, \"Mumbai\")\nname, age, city = person\nprint(f\"{name} is {age} years old from {city}\")\n\n# Swap values\na, b = 10, 20\na, b = b, a  # Swap using tuple unpacking\nprint(f\"a={a}, b={b}\")  # a=20, b=10\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2️⃣ Dictionaries (25 minutes)\n\n**What is a Dictionary?**\n\n\"A dictionary stores key-value pairs. Like a real dictionary: word (key) → definition (value). Like a phone book: name (key) → number (value).\"\n\n**Creating Dictionaries:**\n\n```python\n# Empty dictionary\nempty_dict = {}\n\n# Dictionary with data\nstudent = {\n    \"name\": \"John\",\n    \"age\": 20,\n    \"grade\": \"A\",\n    \"city\": \"Mumbai\"\n}\n\n# Another way\nperson = dict(name=\"Alice\", age=25, city=\"Delhi\")\n\nprint(student)\nprint(person)\n```\n\n**Accessing Values:**\n\n```python\nstudent = {\n    \"name\": \"John\",\n    \"age\": 20,\n    \"grade\": \"A\"\n}\n\n# Using square brackets\nprint(student[\"name\"])  # John\nprint(student[\"age\"])   # 20\n\n# Using get() - safer (no error if key missing)\nprint(student.get(\"name\"))     # John\nprint(student.get(\"phone\"))    # None (no error!)\nprint(student.get(\"phone\", \"Not available\"))  # Custom default\n```\n\n**Adding/Modifying Values:**\n\n```python\nstudent = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 20}\n\n# Add new key-value\nstudent[\"grade\"] = \"A\"\nstudent[\"city\"] = \"Mumbai\"\nprint(student)\n\n# Modify existing value\nstudent[\"age\"] = 21\nprint(student)\n```\n\n**Removing Items:**\n\n```python\nstudent = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 20, \"grade\": \"A\", \"city\": \"Mumbai\"}\n\n# del - remove by key\ndel student[\"city\"]\nprint(student)\n\n# pop() - remove and return value\ngrade = student.pop(\"grade\")\nprint(f\"Removed grade: {grade}\")\nprint(student)\n\n# popitem() - remove last item (returns tuple)\nitem = student.popitem()\nprint(f\"Removed: {item}\")\n\n# clear() - remove all\nstudent.clear()\nprint(student)  # {}\n```\n\n**Dictionary Methods:**\n\n```python\nstudent = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 20, \"grade\": \"A\"}\n\n# keys() - get all keys\nprint(student.keys())  # dict_keys(['name', 'age', 'grade'])\n\n# values() - get all values\nprint(student.values())  # dict_values(['John', 20, 'A'])\n\n# items() - get key-value pairs\nprint(student.items())  # dict_items([('name', 'John'), ('age', 20), ('grade', 'A')])\n```\n\n**Looping Through Dictionaries:**\n\n```python\nstudent = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 20, \"grade\": \"A\"}\n\n# Loop through keys\nfor key in student:\n    print(key, student[key])\n\n# Loop through keys explicitly\nfor key in student.keys():\n    print(key)\n\n# Loop through values\nfor value in student.values():\n    print(value)\n\n# Loop through key-value pairs (best way!)\nfor key, value in student.items():\n    print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n```\n\n**Checking Keys:**\n\n```python\nstudent = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 20}\n\n# Check if key exists\nif \"name\" in student:\n    print(\"Name exists\")\n\nif \"phone\" not in student:\n    print(\"Phone not found\")\n```\n\n**Nested Dictionaries:**\n\n```python\n# Dictionary of dictionaries\nstudents = {\n    \"101\": {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 20, \"grade\": \"A\"},\n    \"102\": {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 22, \"grade\": \"B\"},\n    \"103\": {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 21, \"grade\": \"A\"}\n}\n\n# Access nested data\nprint(students[\"101\"][\"name\"])  # John\nprint(students[\"102\"][\"grade\"])  # B\n\n# Loop through nested\nfor roll_no, info in students.items():\n    print(f\"\\nRoll No: {roll_no}\")\n    for key, value in info.items():\n        print(f\"  {key}: {value}\")\n```\n\n**Practical Example: Shopping Cart**\n\n```python\ncart = {}\n\n# Add items\ncart[\"Laptop\"] = 45000\ncart[\"Mouse\"] = 500\ncart[\"Keyboard\"] = 1500\n\n# Display cart\nprint(\"🛒 Shopping Cart:\")\ntotal = 0\nfor item, price in cart.items():\n    print(f\"{item}: ₹{price}\")\n    total += price\nprint(f\"\\nTotal: ₹{total}\")\n\n# Update quantity (value can be dict too)\ncart_with_qty = {\n    \"Laptop\": {\"price\": 45000, \"qty\": 1},\n    \"Mouse\": {\"price\": 500, \"qty\": 2}\n}\n\ntotal = 0\nfor item, details in cart_with_qty.items():\n    subtotal = details[\"price\"] * details[\"qty\"]\n    print(f\"{item} x {details['qty']} = ₹{subtotal}\")\n    total += subtotal\nprint(f\"Total: ₹{total}\")\n```\n\n**Example: Word Counter**\n\n```python\ntext = \"hello world hello python python python\"\nwords = text.split()\n\n# Count word frequency\nword_count = {}\nfor word in words:\n    if word in word_count:\n        word_count[word] += 1\n    else:\n        word_count[word] = 1\n\nprint(word_count)\n# Output: {'hello': 2, 'world': 1, 'python': 3}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3️⃣ Sets (15 minutes)\n\n**What is a Set?**\n\n\"A set is a collection of UNIQUE items (no duplicates). UNORDERED (no indexing). Like a bag of unique marbles.\"\n\n**Creating Sets:**\n\n```python\n# Using curly braces\nfruits = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"mango\"}\nprint(fruits)  # {'apple', 'banana', 'mango'}\n\n# Using set() function\nnumbers = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nprint(numbers)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n# From string (unique characters)\nletters = set(\"hello\")\nprint(letters)  # {'h', 'e', 'l', 'o'} - no duplicate 'l'\n\n# Empty set (must use set(), not {})\nempty = set()  # ✅ Correct\n# empty = {}  # ❌ Wrong - this is a dictionary!\n```\n\n**Sets Automatically Remove Duplicates:**\n\n```python\nnumbers = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5, 1}\nprint(numbers)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - duplicates removed!\n\n# Remove duplicates from list\nnumbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5, 1]\nunique = set(numbers_list)\nprint(unique)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n# Convert back to list\nunique_list = list(unique)\nprint(unique_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\n**Sets are UNORDERED:**\n\n```python\nfruits = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"mango\"}\n\n# ❌ No indexing\n# print(fruits[0])  # Error: set object is not subscriptable\n\n# ✅ Can check membership\nif \"apple\" in fruits:\n    print(\"Apple exists\")\n```\n\n**Adding/Removing Items:**\n\n```python\nfruits = {\"apple\", \"banana\"}\n\n# add() - add single item\nfruits.add(\"mango\")\nprint(fruits)  # {'apple', 'banana', 'mango'}\n\n# update() - add multiple items\nfruits.update([\"orange\", \"grape\"])\nprint(fruits)  # {'apple', 'banana', 'mango', 'orange', 'grape'}\n\n# remove() - remove item (error if not found)\nfruits.remove(\"banana\")\nprint(fruits)\n\n# discard() - remove item (no error if not found)\nfruits.discard(\"kiwi\")  # No error\n\n# pop() - remove random item\nremoved = fruits.pop()\nprint(f\"Removed: {removed}\")\n\n# clear() - remove all\nfruits.clear()\n```\n\n**Set Operations (Math):**\n\n```python\nset1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nset2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\n# Union (all items from both) - |\nunion = set1 | set2\nprint(f\"Union: {union}\")  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\n# Intersection (common items) - &\nintersection = set1 & set2\nprint(f\"Intersection: {intersection}\")  # {4, 5}\n\n# Difference (in set1 but not set2) - -\ndifference = set1 - set2\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference}\")  # {1, 2, 3}\n\n# Symmetric Difference (not in both) - ^\nsym_diff = set1 ^ set2\nprint(f\"Symmetric Difference: {sym_diff}\")  # {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\n```\n\n**Practical Example: Find Common Friends**\n\n```python\njohn_friends = {\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\"}\nalice_friends = {\"Bob\", \"David\", \"Emma\", \"Frank\"}\n\n# Common friends\ncommon = john_friends & alice_friends\nprint(f\"Common friends: {common}\")  # {'Bob', 'David'}\n\n# John's unique friends\njohn_unique = john_friends - alice_friends\nprint(f\"John's unique friends: {john_unique}\")  # {'Alice', 'Charlie'}\n\n# All friends\nall_friends = john_friends | alice_friends\nprint(f\"All friends: {all_friends}\")\n```\n\n**Remove Duplicates from List:**\n\n```python\n# With duplicates\nemails = [\"john@email.com\", \"alice@email.com\", \"john@email.com\", \n          \"bob@email.com\", \"alice@email.com\"]\n\n# Remove duplicates\nunique_emails = list(set(emails))\nprint(unique_emails)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4️⃣ Data Structure Comparison (10 minutes)\n\n**When to Use What?**\n\n| Data Structure | Ordered? | Mutable? | Duplicates? | Indexing? | Use Case |\n|---------------|----------|----------|-------------|-----------|----------|\n| **List** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | General purpose, ordered collection |\n| **Tuple** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Fixed data, faster than lists |\n| **Dictionary** | ✅ Yes* | ✅ Yes | ❌ Keys unique | ✅ By key | Key-value pairs, fast lookup |\n| **Set** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | Unique items, math operations |\n\n*Dictionaries maintain insertion order (Python 3.7+)\n\n**Quick Examples:**\n\n```python\n# List - When you need order and duplicates\nshopping_list = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"apple\"]  # Duplicates OK\n\n# Tuple - When data shouldn't change\ndate = (2025, 1, 15)  # Fixed date\n\n# Dictionary - When you need key-value mapping\nperson = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 20}  # Fast lookup by key\n\n# Set - When you need unique items\nunique_ids = {101, 102, 103, 102}  # Auto removes duplicate 102\n```\n\n**Choosing the Right Structure:**\n\n```python\n# Example: Student Marks System\n\n# List - Store all attempts (including duplicates)\nattempts = [85, 90, 85, 92, 88]\n\n# Tuple - Store fixed info\nstudent_info = (\"John\", 101, \"Computer Science\")\n\n# Dictionary - Store marks by subject\nmarks = {\n    \"Math\": 85,\n    \"Python\": 92,\n    \"Database\": 88\n}\n\n# Set - Store unique tags/skills\nskills = {\"Python\", \"Django\", \"SQL\", \"Python\"}  # Removes duplicate\n```\n\n**Performance Comparison:**\n\n```python\n# Lookup speed test concept\n# List: O(n) - checks each item\n# Dictionary: O(1) - direct access by key\n# Set: O(1) - for membership check\n\n# For 1 million items:\n# List lookup: Slow (checks all)\n# Dict/Set lookup: Fast (direct access)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 💡 Real-World Examples\n\n**Example 1: Restaurant Menu System (Dictionary)**\n```python\nmenu = {\n    \"Pizza\": 12.99,\n    \"Burger\": 8.50,\n    \"Pasta\": 10.75,\n    \"Salad\": 6.99,\n    \"Coke\": 2.50\n}\n\nprint(\"🍕 Restaurant Menu\")\nprint(\"=\" * 40)\n\n# Display menu\nfor item, price in menu.items():\n    print(f\"{item:.<20} ${price:.2f}\")\n\n# Take order\norder = {}\nwhile True:\n    item = input(\"\\nOrder item (or 'done'): \").title()\n    \n    if item.lower() == 'done':\n        break\n    \n    if item in menu:\n        quantity = int(input(f\"Quantity of {item}: \"))\n        order[item] = order.get(item, 0) + quantity\n        print(f\"✓ Added {quantity} {item}(s)\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"❌ {item} not on menu!\")\n\n# Calculate bill\nprint(\"\\n\" + \"=\" * 40)\nprint(\"📋 Your Order:\")\ntotal = 0\nfor item, qty in order.items():\n    price = menu[item] * qty\n    total += price\n    print(f\"{item} x{qty}: ${price:.2f}\")\n\nprint(\"=\" * 40)\nprint(f\"💰 Total: ${total:.2f}\")\n```\n\n**Example 2: Student Database**\n```python\nstudents = {\n    \"S001\": {\n        \"name\": \"Alice Johnson\",\n        \"age\": 20,\n        \"major\": \"Computer Science\",\n        \"gpa\": 3.8,\n        \"courses\": [\"Python\", \"Data Structures\", \"Algorithms\"]\n    },\n    \"S002\": {\n        \"name\": \"Bob Smith\",\n        \"age\": 21,\n        \"major\": \"Data Science\",\n        \"gpa\": 3.6,\n        \"courses\": [\"Python\", \"Statistics\", \"Machine Learning\"]\n    },\n    \"S003\": {\n        \"name\": \"Carol White\",\n        \"age\": 19,\n        \"major\": \"AI\",\n        \"gpa\": 3.9,\n        \"courses\": [\"Python\", \"Neural Networks\", \"Deep Learning\"]\n    }\n}\n\n# Search student\nstudent_id = input(\"Enter Student ID: \")\nif student_id in students:\n    student = students[student_id]\n    print(f\"\\n📚 Student Info:\")\n    print(f\"Name: {student['name']}\")\n    print(f\"Age: {student['age']}\")\n    print(f\"Major: {student['major']}\")\n    print(f\"GPA: {student['gpa']}\")\n    print(f\"Courses: {', '.join(student['courses'])}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"❌ Student not found!\")\n\n# Find students in Python course\npython_students = [s['name'] for s in students.values() if 'Python' in s['courses']]\nprint(f\"\\n🐍 Students taking Python: {', '.join(python_students)}\")\n```\n\n**Example 3: Unique Visitor Tracking (Sets)**\n```python\n# Track unique website visitors\nvisitors_monday = {\"user123\", \"user456\", \"user789\", \"user123\"}  # Duplicate ignored\nvisitors_tuesday = {\"user456\", \"user999\", \"user111\"}\n\nprint(f\"Monday visitors: {visitors_monday}\")  # Only unique\nprint(f\"Tuesday visitors: {visitors_tuesday}\")\n\n# Who visited both days?\nrepeat_visitors = visitors_monday & visitors_tuesday  # Intersection\nprint(f\"\\n🔄 Repeat visitors: {repeat_visitors}\")\n\n# Who visited either day?\nall_visitors = visitors_monday | visitors_tuesday  # Union\nprint(f\"👥 Total unique visitors: {len(all_visitors)}\")\n\n# Who visited only Monday?\nmonday_only = visitors_monday -

Like a car breaking down - we need a plan to handle it!\"\n\n**Without Exception Handling (Program Crashes):**\n\n```python\n# This will crash the program!\nnumber = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))  # If user enters \"abc\"\nresult = 10 / number  # If user enters 0\nprint(result)\n\n# ❌ Program stops with error!\n# User sees ugly error message\n```\n\n**With Exception Handling (Graceful):**\n\n```python\ntry:\n    number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    result = 10 / number\n    print(f\"Result: {result}\")\nexcept:\n    print(\"❌ Something went wrong! Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n# ✅ Program continues, user-friendly message\n```\n\n**Try/Except Structure:**\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Code that might cause error\n    risky_code()\nexcept:\n    # Code to run if error occurs\n    print(\"Error handled\")\n```\n\n**Example 1: Safe Division**\n\n```python\ntry:\n    a = int(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n    b = int(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n    result = a / b\n    print(f\"Result: {result}\")\nexcept:\n    print(\"Error! Please enter valid numbers and don't divide by zero.\")\n```\n\n**Catching Specific Exceptions:**\n\n```python\ntry:\n    number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    result = 10 / number\n    print(f\"Result: {result}\")\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"❌ Please enter a valid number (not text)\")\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"❌ Cannot divide by zero!\")\n```\n\n**Getting Error Message:**\n\n```python\ntry:\n    number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    result = 10 / number\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error occurred: {e}\")\n    print(f\"Error type: {type(e).__name__}\")\n```\n\n**Common Exception Types:**\n\n```python\n# ValueError - Invalid value\ntry:\n    int(\"abc\")  # Can't convert \"abc\" to int\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Invalid value\")\n\n# ZeroDivisionError - Division by zero\ntry:\n    10 / 0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n\n# IndexError - Index out of range\ntry:\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n    print(numbers[10])  # Index 10 doesn't exist\nexcept IndexError:\n    print(\"Index not found\")\n\n# KeyError - Dictionary key not found\ntry:\n    person = {\"name\": \"John\"}\n    print(person[\"age\"])  # Key 'age' doesn't exist\nexcept KeyError:\n    print(\"Key not found\")\n\n# FileNotFoundError - File doesn't exist\ntry:\n    file = open(\"nonexistent.txt\")\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2️⃣ Multiple Exceptions (10 minutes)\n\n**Handling Multiple Exceptions Separately:**\n\n```python\ndef calculator():\n    try:\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n        operation = input(\"Enter operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n        \n        if operation == \"+\":\n            result = num1 + num2\n        elif operation == \"-\":\n            result = num1 - num2\n        elif operation == \"*\":\n            result = num1 * num2\n        elif operation == \"/\":\n            result = num1 / num2\n        else:\n            result = \"Invalid operation\"\n        \n        print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n        \n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"❌ Please enter valid numbers\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        print(\"❌ Cannot divide by zero\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"❌ Unexpected error: {e}\")\n\ncalculator()\n```\n\n**Multiple Exceptions in One Line:**\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Some code\n    pass\nexcept (ValueError, TypeError, ZeroDivisionError):\n    print(\"One of these errors occurred\")\n```\n\n**Example: Safe List Access**\n\n```python\ndef get_list_item(my_list, index):\n    try:\n        return my_list[index]\n    except IndexError:\n        return f\"❌ Index {index} out of range (list has {len(my_list)} items)\"\n    except TypeError:\n        return \"❌ Index must be a number\"\n\n# Test\nnumbers = [10, 20, 30]\nprint(get_list_item(numbers, 1))   # 20\nprint(get_list_item(numbers, 10))  # Error message\nprint(get_list_item(numbers, \"a\")) # Error message\n```\n\n**Example: Safe Dictionary Access**\n\n```python\ndef get_student_info(student_id):\n    students = {\n        101: {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 20},\n        102: {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 22}\n    }\n    \n    try:\n        student = students[student_id]\n        return f\"Name: {student['name']}, Age: {student['age']}\"\n    except KeyError:\n        return f\"❌ Student ID {student_id} not found\"\n    except TypeError:\n        return \"❌ Student ID must be a number\"\n\n# Test\nprint(get_student_info(101))  # Found\nprint(get_student_info(999))  # Not found\nprint(get_student_info(\"abc\"))  # Invalid type\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3️⃣ Finally & Else (10 minutes)\n\n**The 'finally' Clause:**\n\n\"finally block ALWAYS executes, whether error occurs or not. Like washing hands after eating - always do it!\"\n\n```python\ntry:\n    file = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n    content = file.read()\n    print(content)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\nfinally:\n    print(\"Cleaning up...\")\n    # file.close()  # Always close file (even if error)\n    print(\"Done\")\n```\n\n**Example: Database Connection Pattern**\n\n```python\ndef process_data():\n    try:\n        print(\"1. Connecting to database...\")\n        # connection = connect_to_database()\n        \n        print(\"2. Processing data...\")\n        # process_data()\n        \n        print(\"3. Saving results...\")\n        # save_results()\n        \n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"❌ Error: {e}\")\n    finally:\n        print(\"4. Closing database connection...\")\n        # Always close connection, even if error\n        # connection.close()\n\nprocess_data()\n```\n\n**The 'else' Clause:**\n\n\"else block runs ONLY if NO exception occurred. Like a reward for success!\"\n\n```python\ntry:\n    number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"❌ Invalid number\")\nelse:\n    print(\"✅ Success! You entered:\", number)\n    print(\"No errors occurred\")\nfinally:\n    print(\"Program finished\")\n```\n\n**Complete Structure:**\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Code that might cause error\n    result = 10 / 2\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    # Runs if error occurs\n    print(\"Error!\")\nelse:\n    # Runs if NO error\n    print(f\"Success! Result: {result}\")\nfinally:\n    # ALWAYS runs\n    print(\"Cleanup done\")\n```\n\n**Practical Example: File Processing**\n\n```python\ndef read_file_safely(filename):\n    try:\n        print(f\"Opening file: {filename}\")\n        file = open(filename, \"r\")\n        content = file.read()\n        \n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"❌ File '{filename}' not found\")\n        content = None\n        \n    except PermissionError:\n        print(f\"❌ No permission to read '{filename}'\")\n        content = None\n        \n    else:\n        print(\"✅ File read successfully\")\n        \n    finally:\n        try:\n            file.close()\n            print(\"✅ File closed\")\n        except:\n            pass  # File was never opened\n    \n    return content\n\n# Test\nread_file_safely(\"test.txt\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4️⃣ File Operations (20 minutes)\n\n**What is a File?**\n\n\"Files store data permanently on disk. Like a notebook - you can write, read, and save information.\"\n\n**Opening Files - Modes:**\n\n| Mode | Description | Creates if not exists? |\n|------|-------------|----------------------|\n| `'r'` | Read (default) | ❌ No (error if missing) |\n| `'w'` | Write (overwrites) | ✅ Yes |\n| `'a'` | Append (add to end) | ✅ Yes |\n| `'x'` | Create (error if exists) | ✅ Yes |\n| `'r+'` | Read + Write | ❌ No |\n\n**Writing to Files:**\n\n```python\n# Write mode (creates new or overwrites existing)\nfile = open(\"example.txt\", \"w\")\nfile.write(\"Hello, World!\\n\")\nfile.write(\"This is Python.\\n\")\nfile.write(\"File operations are easy!\")\nfile.close()\n\nprint(\"✅ File created successfully\")\n```\n\n**Reading from Files:**\n\n```python\n# Read entire file\nfile = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\ncontent = file.read()\nprint(content)\nfile.close()\n\n# Read line by line\nfile = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\nfor line in file:\n    print(line.strip())  # strip() removes \\n\nfile.close()\n\n# Read all lines into list\nfile = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\nlines = file.readlines()  # Returns list\nprint(lines)\nfile.close()\n```\n\n**Using 'with' Statement (Best Practice):**\n\n\"with automatically closes the file - like a self-closing door!\"\n\n```python\n# ✅ Better way - auto-closes file\nwith open(\"example.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n    file.write(\"Hello, World!\\n\")\n    file.write(\"Python is awesome!\")\n# File automatically closed here!\n\n# Read with 'with'\nwith open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    content = file.read()\n    print(content)\n# File automatically closed here!\n```\n\n**Append Mode:**\n\n```python\n# Add to existing file (doesn't overwrite)\nwith open(\"log.txt\", \"a\") as file:\n    file.write(\"New log entry\\n\")\n    file.write(\"Another entry\\n\")\n\n# Existing content is preserved!\n```\n\n**Example 1: To-Do List App**\n\n```python\ndef add_task(task):\n    with open(\"todo.txt\", \"a\") as file:\n        file.write(f\"{task}\\n\")\n    print(f\"✅ Added: {task}\")\n\ndef view_tasks():\n    try:\n        with open(\"todo.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n            tasks = file.readlines()\n            print(\"\\n📝 To-Do List:\")\n            for i, task in enumerate(tasks, 1):\n                print(f\"{i}. {task.strip()}\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"No tasks yet\")\n\n# Test\nadd_task(\"Buy groceries\")\nadd_task(\"Study Python\")\nadd_task(\"Exercise\")\nview_tasks()\n```\n\n**Example 2: Student Marks System**\n\n```python\ndef save_marks(name, marks):\n    with open(\"marks.txt\", \"a\") as file:\n        file.write(f\"{name},{marks}\\n\")\n\ndef read_all_marks():\n    try:\n        with open(\"marks.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n            print(\"\\n📊 Student Marks:\")\n            for line in file:\n                name, marks = line.strip().split(\",\")\n                print(f\"{name}: {marks}\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"No marks recorded yet\")\n\n# Test\nsave_marks(\"John\", 85)\nsave_marks(\"Alice\", 92)\nsave_marks(\"Bob\", 78)\nread_all_marks()\n```\n\n**File Path (Absolute vs Relative):**\n\n```python\n# Relative path (from current directory)\nwith open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    content = file.read()\n\n# Absolute path (full path)\nwith open(\"/Users/username/documents/data.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    content = file.read()\n\n# Create in specific folder\nwith open(\"logs/app.log\", \"a\") as file:\n    file.write(\"Log entry\\n\")\n```\n\n**Checking if File Exists:**\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nfilename = \"example.txt\"\n\nif os.path.exists(filename):\n    print(f\"✅ {filename} exists\")\n    with open(filename, \"r\") as file:\n        print(file.read())\nelse:\n    print(f\"❌ {filename} not found\")\n```\n\n**Example 3: Simple Contact Book**\n\n```python\ndef add_contact(name, phone):\n    with open(\"contacts.txt\", \"a\") as file:\n        file.write(f\"{name}|{phone}\\n\")\n    print(f\"✅ Contact added: {name}\")\n\ndef search_contact(name):\n    try:\n        with open(\"contacts.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n            for line in file:\n                contact_name, phone = line.strip().split(\"|\")\n                if contact_name.lower() == name.lower():\n                    print(f\"📞 {contact_name}: {phone}\")\n                    return\n            print(f\"❌ {name} not found\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"No contacts yet\")\n\ndef view_all_contacts():\n    try:\n        with open(\"contacts.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n            print(\"\\n📕 All Contacts:\")\n            for line in file:\n                name, phone = line.strip().split(\"|\")\n                print(f\"  {name}: {phone}\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"No contacts yet\")\n\n# Test\nadd_contact(\"John\", \"9876543210\")\nadd_contact(\"Alice\", \"9123456789\")\nadd_contact(\"Bob\", \"9988776655\")\nview_all_contacts()\nsearch_contact(\"Alice\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5️⃣ Best Practices (5 minutes)\n\n**1. Always Use 'with' Statement:**\n\n```python\n# ❌ Bad - might not close if error\nfile = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\ncontent = file.read()\nfile.close()\n\n# ✅ Good - always closes\nwith open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    content = file.read()\n```\n\n**2. Handle Specific Exceptions:**\n\n```python\n# ❌ Bad - catches everything\ntry:\n    file = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\nexcept:\n    print(\"Error\")\n\n# ✅ Good - specific handling\ntry:\n    file = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\nexcept PermissionError:\n    print(\"No permission\")\n```\n\n**3. Don't Ignore Exceptions:**\n\n```python\n# ❌ Bad - silent failure\ntry:\n    result = 10 / 0\nexcept:\n    pass  # Problem hidden!\n\n# ✅ Good - log or handle properly\ntry:\n    result = 10 / 0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    result = None\n```\n\n**4. Use finally for Cleanup:**\n\n```python\ntry:\n    file = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n    # Process file\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\nfinally:\n    try:\n        file.close()  # Always close\n    except:\n        pass\n```\n\n**5.

Magic Methods (10 min)\n\n---\n\n## 📝 DETAILED LESSON CONTENT\n\n### 1️⃣ Classes & Objects (20 minutes)\n\n**What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n\n\"OOP is programming with 'objects' - like real-world things. A car, a person, a bank account - all are objects with properties and actions.\"\n\n**What is a Class?**\n\n\"A class is a blueprint/template. Like a car design - not the actual car, but the plan to build one.\"\n\n**What is an Object?**\n\n\"An object is an instance of a class. Like an actual car built from the design. You can build many cars from one design!\"\n\n**Creating a Simple Class:**\n\n```python\n# Define a class (blueprint)\nclass Dog:\n    def bark(self):\n        print(\"Woof! Woof!\")\n\n# Create objects (instances)\ndog1 = Dog()  # First dog\ndog2 = Dog()  # Second dog\n\n# Call methods\ndog1.bark()  # Woof! Woof!\ndog2.bark()  # Woof! Woof!\n```\n\n**Class with Attributes:**\n\n```python\nclass Person:\n    # Attributes (properties)\n    name = \"Unknown\"\n    age = 0\n    \n    # Methods (actions)\n    def introduce(self):\n        print(f\"Hi, I'm {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old\")\n\n# Create object\nperson1 = Person()\nperson1.name = \"John\"\nperson1.age = 25\nperson1.introduce()  # Hi, I'm John and I'm 25 years old\n\nperson2 = Person()\nperson2.name = \"Alice\"\nperson2.age = 30\nperson2.introduce()  # Hi, I'm Alice and I'm 30 years old\n```\n\n**What is 'self'?**\n\n\"'self' refers to the current object. Like saying 'me' or 'myself'.\"\n\n```python\nclass Student:\n    def set_name(self, name):\n        self.name = name  # self.name = this object's name\n    \n    def get_name(self):\n        return self.name\n\n# Create two students\nstudent1 = Student()\nstudent1.set_name(\"John\")\n\nstudent2 = Student()\nstudent2.set_name(\"Alice\")\n\nprint(student1.get_name())  # John\nprint(student2.get_name())  # Alice\n```\n\n**Example: Bank Account (Without Constructor)**\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance = self.balance + amount\n        print(f\"Deposited: ₹{amount}\")\n    \n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance = self.balance - amount\n            print(f\"Withdrawn: ₹{amount}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient balance\")\n    \n    def show_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Balance: ₹{self.balance}\")\n\n# Create account\naccount = BankAccount()\naccount.balance = 1000  # Set initial balance manually\naccount.show_balance()\naccount.deposit(500)\naccount.withdraw(200)\naccount.show_balance()\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2️⃣ Constructor (__init__) (15 minutes)\n\n**What is a Constructor?**\n\n\"A constructor is a special method that automatically runs when you create an object. Like a setup function!\"\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n```python\nclass ClassName:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialization code\n        pass\n```\n\n**Constructor with Parameters:**\n\n```python\nclass Person:\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n        print(f\"Person created: {name}\")\n    \n    def introduce(self):\n        print(f\"I'm {self.name}, {self.age} years old\")\n\n# Constructor automatically called\nperson1 = Person(\"John\", 25)  # Person created: John\nperson1.introduce()  # I'm John, 25 years old\n\nperson2 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)  # Person created: Alice\nperson2.introduce()  # I'm Alice, 30 years old\n```\n\n**Example: Rectangle Class**\n\n```python\nclass Rectangle:\n    def __init__(self, length, width):\n        self.length = length\n        self.width = width\n        print(f\"Rectangle created: {length} x {width}\")\n    \n    def area(self):\n        return self.length * self.width\n    \n    def perimeter(self):\n        return 2 * (self.length + self.width)\n    \n    def display(self):\n        print(f\"Length: {self.length}\")\n        print(f\"Width: {self.width}\")\n        print(f\"Area: {self.area()}\")\n        print(f\"Perimeter: {self.perimeter()}\")\n\n# Create rectangles\nrect1 = Rectangle(10, 5)\nrect1.display()\n\nprint()\n\nrect2 = Rectangle(20, 15)\nrect2.display()\n```\n\n**Example: Student Class**\n\n```python\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, roll_no, marks):\n        self.name = name\n        self.roll_no = roll_no\n        self.marks = marks\n    \n    def calculate_grade(self):\n        if self.marks >= 90:\n            return \"A\"\n        elif self.marks >= 80:\n            return \"B\"\n        elif self.marks >= 70:\n            return \"C\"\n        elif self.marks >= 60:\n            return \"D\"\n        else:\n            return \"F\"\n    \n    def display_info(self):\n        print(f\"Name: {self.name}\")\n        print(f\"Roll No: {self.roll_no}\")\n        print(f\"Marks: {self.marks}\")\n        print(f\"Grade: {self.calculate_grade()}\")\n\n# Create students\nstudent1 = Student(\"John\", 101, 85)\nstudent1.display_info()\n\nprint()\n\nstudent2 = Student(\"Alice\", 102, 92)\nstudent2.display_info()\n```\n\n**Bank Account with Constructor:**\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, account_holder, initial_balance=0):\n        self.account_holder = account_holder\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n        print(f\"Account created for {account_holder}\")\n    \n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"✅ Deposited: ₹{amount}\")\n        print(f\"New Balance: ₹{self.balance}\")\n    \n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"✅ Withdrawn: ₹{amount}\")\n            print(f\"New Balance: ₹{self.balance}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"❌ Insufficient balance\")\n    \n    def get_balance(self):\n        return self.balance\n\n# Create accounts\naccount1 = BankAccount(\"John\", 5000)\naccount1.deposit(1000)\naccount1.withdraw(2000)\n\nprint()\n\naccount2 = BankAccount(\"Alice\", 10000)\naccount2.withdraw(3000)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3️⃣ Inheritance (15 minutes)\n\n**What is Inheritance?**\n\n\"Inheritance lets one class inherit properties and methods from another. Like children inheriting traits from parents!\"\n\n**Basic Inheritance:**\n\n```python\n# Parent class (Base class)\nclass Animal:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n    \n    def eat(self):\n        print(f\"{self.name} is eating\")\n    \n    def sleep(self):\n        print(f\"{self.name} is sleeping\")\n\n# Child class (Derived class)\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    def bark(self):\n        print(f\"{self.name} says: Woof!

It helps you build websites and web applications FAST! Like WordPress, but you write Python code.\"\n\n**Why Django?**\n\n1. **Fast Development** - Build websites quickly\n2. **Secure** - Built-in security features\n3. **Scalable** - Used by Instagram, Pinterest, NASA!\n4. **Batteries Included** - Everything you need is included\n\n**What Django Does:**\n\n```\nBrowser Request → Django → Database\n                   ↓\nBrowser ← HTML Page ← Django\n```\n\n**Django Architecture (MVT Pattern):**\n\n```\nM - Model (Database)\nV - View (Logic/Processing)\nT - Template (HTML Display)\n```\n\n**Example: Blog Concept**\n\n```python\n# Model - What data looks like\nclass BlogPost:\n    title = \"My First Blog\"\n    content = \"This is my content\"\n    author = \"John\"\n    date = \"2025-01-15\"\n\n# View - What happens when user visits\ndef show_blog(request):\n    posts = get_all_posts()\n    return render(template, posts)\n\n# Template - What user sees (HTML)\n<h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>\n<p>{{ post.content }}</p>\n<small>By {{ post.author }}</small>\n```\n\n**Django Project Structure:**\n\n```\nmyproject/\n    manage.py          # Command line tool\n    myproject/\n        settings.py    # Configuration\n        urls.py        # URL routing\n    myapp/\n        models.py      # Database models\n        views.py       # Business logic\n        templates/     # HTML files\n```\n\n**Django Installation (Show concept, not practice):**\n\n```bash\n# Install Django\npip install django\n\n# Create project\ndjango-admin startproject myproject\n\n# Create app\npython manage.py startapp blog\n\n# Run server\npython manage.py runserver\n```\n\n**Django URL Routing:**\n\n```python\n# urls.py - Map URLs to views\nfrom django.urls import path\nfrom . import views\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('', views.home),              # Home page\n    path('about/', views.about),       # About page\n    path('blog/', views.blog_list),    # Blog list\n    path('blog/<int:id>/', views.blog_detail),  # Individual blog\n]\n```\n\n**Django Views (Functions):**\n\n```python\n# views.py\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse\n\ndef home(request):\n    return HttpResponse(\"Welcome to Home Page!\")\n\ndef about(request):\n    return render(request, 'about.html')\n\ndef blog_list(request):\n    blogs = [\n        {\"title\": \"Python Basics\", \"author\": \"John\"},\n        {\"title\": \"Django Tutorial\", \"author\": \"Alice\"}\n    ]\n    return render(request, 'blog_list.html', {'blogs': blogs})\n```\n\n**Django Templates (HTML):**\n\n```html\n<!-- blog_list.html -->\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Blog List</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>All Blogs</h1>\n    \n    {% for blog in blogs %}\n        <div>\n            <h2>{{ blog.title }}</h2>\n            <p>By {{ blog.author }}</p>\n        </div>\n    {% endfor %}\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Django Models (Database):**\n\n```python\n# models.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass BlogPost(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n    content = models.TextField()\n    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.title\n\n# Django automatically creates database tables!\n```\n\n**Django Admin Panel:**\n\n\"Django gives you a FREE admin panel to manage data! No coding needed!\"\n\n```python\n# admin.py\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom .models import BlogPost\n\nadmin.site.register(BlogPost)\n\n# Now you can add/edit/delete blog posts from web interface!\n```\n\n**Real-World Django Examples:**\n\n1. **Instagram** - Photo sharing\n2. **Pinterest** - Image bookmarking\n3. **Disqus** - Comment system\n4. **Spotify** - Music streaming\n5. **YouTube** - Video platform (some parts)\n\n**What You Can Build with Django:**\n\n- 🌐 Websites & Blogs\n- 🛒 E-commerce sites\n- 📱 Social media platforms\n- 📊 Data dashboards\n- 🔐 Authentication systems\n- 📧 Email applications\n- 📰 News portals\n\n---\n\n### 2️⃣ Machine Learning Basics (20 minutes)\n\n**What is Machine Learning (ML)?**\n\n\"Machine Learning is teaching computers to learn from data, without explicitly programming every rule. Like teaching a child to recognize animals by showing pictures!\"\n\n**Traditional Programming vs ML:**\n\n```\nTraditional Programming:\nInput + Rules → Output\n\nMachine Learning:\nInput + Output → Rules (learned automatically)\n```\n\n**Example: Email Spam Filter**\n\n**Traditional Way (Hard to code):**\n```python\ndef is_spam(email):\n    if \"lottery\" in email:\n        return True\n    if \"FREE\" in email:\n        return True\n    if \"winner\" in email:\n        return True\n    # Need to code 1000s of rules!\n```\n\n**ML Way (Learns automatically):**\n```python\n# Train on 10,000 emails (spam and not spam)\nmodel.train(emails, labels)\n\n# Now it can predict new emails automatically!\nresult = model.predict(new_email)\n```\n\n**Types of Machine Learning:**\n\n1. **Supervised Learning** - Learn from labeled examples\n   - Example: House price prediction (given size, location → predict price)\n   - Example: Image classification (cat vs dog)\n\n2. **Unsupervised Learning** - Find patterns in data\n   - Example: Customer grouping (find similar customers)\n   - Example: Anomaly detection (find unusual behavior)\n\n3. **Reinforcement Learning** - Learn by trial and error\n   - Example: Game playing AI\n   - Example: Self-driving cars\n\n**Simple ML Example: House Price Prediction**\n\n```\nGiven data:\nSize (sq ft)  →  Price (₹ lakhs)\n1000         →  50\n1500         →  75\n2000         →  100\n2500         →  125\n\nNew house: 1800 sq ft → Predict price?\n\nML learns the pattern:\nPrice = Size × 0.05\nSo, 1800 × 0.05 = 90 lakhs\n```\n\n**Python ML Libraries:**\n\n```python\n# NumPy - Mathematical operations\nimport numpy as np\nnumbers = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nprint(numbers.mean())  # 3.0\n\n# Pandas - Data handling\nimport pandas as pd\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\")\nprint(data.head())\n\n# Matplotlib - Graphs\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])\nplt.show()\n\n# Scikit-learn - ML algorithms\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nmodel = LinearRegression()\nmodel.fit(X, y)  # Train\nprediction = model.predict(new_data)  # Predict\n```\n\n**Simple ML Code Example (Concept):**\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Import library\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\n# Step 2: Prepare data\n# Size of houses\nX = [[1000], [1500], [2000], [2500]]\n# Prices\ny = [50, 75, 100, 125]\n\n# Step 3: Create and train model\nmodel = LinearRegression()\nmodel.fit(X, y)  # Learn from data\n\n# Step 4: Make predictions\nnew_house = [[1800]]\npredicted_price = model.predict(new_house)\nprint(f\"Predicted price: ₹{predicted_price[0]} lakhs\")\n```\n\n**Real-World ML Applications:**\n\n1. **Netflix** - Movie recommendations\n2. **Google** - Search results, translate\n3. **Facebook** - Face recognition\n4. **Spotify** - Music recommendations\n5. **Amazon** - Product recommendations\n6. **Tesla** - Self-driving cars\n7. **Siri/Alexa** - Voice recognition\n8. **Gmail** - Spam filtering\n\n**ML Career Paths:**\n\n- 🤖 Machine Learning Engineer\n- 📊 Data Scientist\n- 🧠 AI Researcher\n- 👁️ Computer Vision Engineer\n- 🗣️ NLP Engineer\n- 📈 Data Analyst\n\n**Steps in ML Project:**\n\n```\n1. Collect Data (Get lots of examples)\n2. Clean Data (Remove errors)\n3. Explore Data (Understand patterns)\n4. Choose Model (Select algorithm)\n5. Train Model (Learn from data)\n6. Test Model (Check accuracy)\n7. Deploy Model (Use in real world)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3️⃣ Final Project Ideas (10 minutes)\n\n**Beginner Level Projects:**\n\n1. **Calculator App**\n   - All operations (+, -, *, /)\n   - Save history to file\n   - GUI with Tkinter\n\n2. **To-Do List Manager**\n   - Add/remove/update tasks\n   - Save to file\n   - Mark as complete\n\n3. **Student Grade System**\n   - Add students\n   - Record marks\n   - Calculate grades\n   - Generate reports\n\n4. **Contact Book**\n   - Add/search/delete contacts\n   - Save to CSV file\n   - Phone number validation\n\n5. **Simple Quiz Game**\n   - Multiple choice questions\n   - Score tracking\n   - Save high scores\n\n**Intermediate Level Projects:**\n\n6. **Expense Tracker**\n   - Add income/expenses\n   - Category-wise tracking\n   - Monthly reports\n   - Data visualization\n\n7. **Library Management**\n   - Add/remove books\n   - Issue/return books\n   - Member management\n   - Fine calculation\n\n8. **Weather App**\n   - Fetch weather API\n   - Show forecast\n   - Multiple cities\n   - GUI interface\n\n9. **Password Manager**\n   - Store passwords securely\n   - Encryption\n   - Master password\n   - Auto-generate passwords\n\n10. **Web Scraper**\n    - Scrape website data\n    - Save to CSV/Excel\n    - Job listings scraper\n    - Price tracker\n\n**Advanced Level Projects:**\n\n11. **Django Blog Website**\n    - User authentication\n    - Create/edit posts\n    - Comments\n    - Admin panel\n\n12. **E-commerce Site**\n    - Product catalog\n    - Shopping cart\n    - Payment integration\n    - Order management\n\n13. **Chat Application**\n    - Real-time messaging\n    - Multiple rooms\n    - User profiles\n    - File sharing\n\n14. **ML Price Predictor**\n    - Collect data\n    - Train model\n    - Web interface\n    - Predict house/car prices\n\n15. **Face Recognition System**\n    - OpenCV\n    - Face detection\n    - Recognition\n    - Attendance system\n\n---\n\n### 4️⃣ Learning Path Forward (10 minutes)\n\n**You've Completed Python Basics! 🎉**\n\n**What You Learned:**\n✅ Variables, Data Types, Operators\n✅ Control Flow (if/else, loops)\n✅ Functions & Scope\n✅ Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Dicts, Sets)\n✅ Exception Handling\n✅ File Operations\n✅ Object-Oriented Programming\n✅ Django & ML Overview\n\n**Next Steps - Choose Your Path:**\n\n**Path 1: Web Development 🌐**\n```\n1.
