### 2.2 Squaring Numbers Near 50

**Method**: For numbers near 50, use the formula:
- (Number - 50) × 100 + (Difference)² + 2500

#### Examples:

**Example 1: 48²**
```
Difference from 50 = -2

48² = 2500 + (-2 × 100) + 4
    = 2500 - 200 + 4
    = 2304
```

**Example 2: 53²**
```
Difference from 50 = +3

53² = 2500 + (3 × 100) + 9
    = 2500 + 300 + 9
    = 2809
```

---

### 2.3 Division by 9

**Method**: The quotient and remainder follow a pattern.

#### Examples:

**Example 1: 456 ÷ 9**
```
Step 1: Write first digit: 4
Step 2: Add to get next: 4 + 5 = 9 → 0 (write 0, we have 10 total)
Step 3: 0 + 6 = 6 → becomes 50, 5 written above
Step 4: Check: 50 × 9 = 450, remainder = 456 - 450 = 6

Quotient: 50
Remainder: 6
Answer: 50 R6 or 50⁶⁄₉
```

**Example 2: 234 ÷ 9**
```

Remainder = 234 - (26 × 9) = 234 - 234 = 0

Answer: 26
```

---

### 2.4 Multiplication by Numbers Near Powers of 10

**Base Method**: When numbers are near 10, 100, 1000, etc.

#### Examples:

**Example 1: 96 × 98** (both near 100)
```
Base = 100
96 is -4 from base
98 is -2 from base

   96  (-4)
   98  (-2)
   --------

Step 1: Cross-subtract: 96 - 2 = 94 (or 98 - 4 = 94)
Step 2: Multiply differences: (-4) × (-2) = 8

Answer: 9408

Verification: Write 94 and append 08 = 9408
```

**Example 2: 103 × 104** (both near 100)

Base = 100
103 is +3 from base
104 is +4 from base

   103  (+3)
   104  (+4)
   ---------

Step 1: Cross-add: 103 + 4 = 107 (or 104 + 3 = 107)
Step 2: Multiply differences: 3 × 4 = 12

Answer: 10712
```

**Example 3: 997 × 998** (both near 1000)
```
Base = 1000
997 is -3 from base
998 is -2 from base

   997  (-3)
   998  (-2)
   ---------

Step 1: Cross-subtract: 997 - 2 = 995
Step 2: Multiply: (-3) × (-2) = 6 → write as 006

Answer: 995006
```

---

### 2.5 Finding Squares Near Base

**Method**: (Number)² = Base + Difference from base + (Difference)²

#### Examples:

**Example 1: 103²** (near 100)
```
Base = 100
Difference = +3

103² = 100 × 106 + 9
     = 10600 + 9
     = 10609

Breaking it down:
- 103 is 3 more than 100
- Add 3 more to 103 = 106
- Multiply by base: 106 × 100 = 10600
- Add square of difference: 3² = 9
```

**Example 2: 97²** (near 100)
```
Base = 100
Difference = -3

97² = 100 × 94 + 9
    = 9400 + 9
    = 9409
```

### 3.3 Algebraic Calculations

**Squaring binomials mentally:**

**Example: (x + 3)²**
```
= x² + 2(3)(x) + 3²
= x² + 6x + 9
```

**Example: (2x + 5)²**
```
= (2x)² + 2(2x)(5) + 5²
= 4x² + 20x + 25
```

---

### 3.4 Cube Roots (Mental Calculation)

**For perfect cubes:**

**Example: ∛21952**

```
Step 1: Last digit is 2
       → Cube root ends in 8 (since 8³ ends in 2)

Step 2: Remove last 3 digits: 21
       2³ = 8, 3³ = 27
       21 is between 8 and 27
       → First digit is 2

Answer: 28
Verify: 28³ = 21952 ✓
```

**Example: ∛13824**

```
Step 1: Last digit is 4
       → Ends in 4 (since 4³ ends in 4)

Step 2: 13 is between 2³(8) and 3³(27)
       → First digit is 2

Answer: 24
Verify: 24³ = 13824 ✓
```

---

### 3.5 Solving Equations Mentally

**Example 1: x² - 7x + 12 = 0**

```
Using mental factoring:
Need two numbers that:
- Multiply to 12
- Add to -7

Numbers: -3 and -4

(x - 3)(x - 4) = 0
x = 3 or x = 4
```

**Example 2: 2x² + 7x + 3 = 0**

```
Factor: (2x + 1)(x + 3) = 0

2x + 1 = 0  →  x = -½
x + 3 = 0   →  x = -3
```
